    <h2><a name="GENERAL_INTRODUCTION" id="GENERAL_INTRODUCTION"></a>GENERAL
    INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p><a href="images/biga.gif"><img src="images/a.gif" alt="Ornate Uppercase Letter A" title="Ornate Uppercase Letter A"
    class="figinit" /></a>new series of 'Books about Books,' exclusively English in its aims, may seem to
    savour of the patriotism which, in matters of art and historical research, is, with
    reason enough, often scoffed at as a treacherous guide. No doubt in these pleasant
    studies patriotism acts as a magnifying-glass, making us unduly exaggerate details.
    On the other hand, it encourages us to try to discover them, and just at present this
    encouragement seems to be needed. There are so many gaps in our knowledge of the
    history of books in England that we can hardly claim that our own dwelling is set in
    order, and yet many of our bookmen appear more inclined to re-decorate their
    neighbours' houses than to do work that still urgently needs to be done at home. The
    reasons for this transference of energy are not far to seek. It is quite easy to be
    struck with the inferiority of English books and their accessories, such as bindings
    and illustrations, to those produced on the Continent. To compare the books printed
    by Caxton with the best work of his German or Italian contemporaries, to compare the
    books bound for Henry, Prince of Wales, with those bound for the Kings of France, to
    try to find even a dozen English books printed before 1640 with woodcuts<span
    class="pagenum">x</span><a name="page_x" id="page_x"></a> (not imported from abroad)
    of any real artistic merit&mdash;if any one is anxious to reinforce his national
    modesty, here are three very efficacious methods of doing it! On the other hand,
    English book-collectors have always been cosmopolitan in their tastes, and without
    leaving England it is possible to study to some effect, in public or private
    libraries, the finest books of almost any foreign country. It is small wonder,
    therefore, that our bookmen, when they have been minded to write on their hobbies,
    have sought beauty and stateliness of work where they could most readily find them,
    and that the labourers in the book-field of our own country are not numerous.
    Touchstone's remark, 'a poor thing, but mine own,' might, on the worst view of the
    case, have suggested greater diligence at home; but on a wider view English book-work
    is by no means a 'poor thing.' Its excellence at certain periods is as striking as
    its inferiority at others, and it is a literal fact that there is no art or craft
    connected with books in which England, at one time or another, has not held the
    primacy in Europe.</p>
    <p>It would certainly be unreasonable to complain that printing with movable types
    was not invent<span class="pagenum">xi</span><a name="page_xi" id="page_xi"></a>ed at
    a time better suited to our national convenience. Yet the fact that the invention was
    made just in the middle of the fifteenth century constituted a handicap by which the
    printing trade in this country was for generations overweighted. At almost any
    earlier period, more particularly from the beginning of the fourteenth century to the
    first quarter of the fifteenth, England would have been as well equipped as any
    foreign country to take its part in the race. From the production of Queen Mary's
    Psalter at the earlier date to that of the Sherborne Missal at the later, English
    manuscripts, if we may judge from the scanty specimens which the evil days of Henry
    <span class="smcap">viii</span>. and Edward <span class="smcap">vi</span>. have left
    us, may vie in beauty of writing and decoration with the finest examples of
    Continental art. If John Siferwas, instead of William Caxton, had introduced printing
    into England, our English incunabula would have taken a far higher place. But the
    sixty odd years which separate the two men were absolutely disastrous to the English
    book-trade. After her exhausting and futile struggle with France, England was torn
    asunder by the wars of the Roses, and by the time these were ended the school of
    illumination, so full of promise, and seemingly so firmly established, had absolutely
    died out. When printing was introduced England possessed<span
    class="pagenum">xii</span><a name="page_xii" id="page_xii"></a> no trained
    illuminators or skilful scribes such as in other countries were forced to make the
    best of the new art in order not to lose their living, nor were there any native
    wood-engravers ready to illustrate the new books. I have never myself seen or heard
    of a 'Caxton' in which an illuminator has painted a preliminary border or initial
    letters; even the rubrication, where it exists, is usually a disfigurement; while as
    for pictures, it has been unkindly said that inquiry whence they were obtained is
    superfluous, since any boy with a knife could have cut them as well.</p>
    <p>Making its start under these unfavourable conditions, the English book-trade was
    exposed at once to the full competition of the Continental presses, Richard <span
    class="smcap">iii</span>. expressly excluding it from the protection which was given
    to other industries. Practically all learned books of every sort, the great majority
    of our service-books, most grammars for use in English schools, and even a few
    popular books of the kind to which Caxton devoted himself, were produced abroad for
    the English market and freely imported. Only those who mistake the shadow for the
    substance will regret this free trade, to which we owe the development of scholarship
    in England during the sixteenth century. None<span class="pagenum">xiii</span><a
    name="page_xiii" id="page_xiii"></a> the less, it was hard on a young industry, and
    though Pynson, Wynkyn de Worde, the Faques, Berthelet, Wolfe, John Day, and others
    produced fine books in England during the sixteenth century, the start given to the
    Continental presses was too great, and before our printers had fully caught up their
    competitors, they too were seized with the carelessness and almost incredible bad
    taste which marks the books of the first half of the seventeenth century in every
    country of Europe.</p>
    <p>Towards the close of the eighteenth century, as is well known, the French thought
    sufficiently well of Baskerville's types to purchase a fount after his death for the
    printing of an important edition of the works of Voltaire. But the merits of
    Baskerville as a printer, never very cordially admitted, are now more hotly disputed
    than ever; and if I am asked at what period English printing has attained that
    occasional primacy which I have claimed for our exponents of all the bookish arts, I
    would boldly say that it possesses it at the present day. On the one hand, the
    Kelmscott Press books, on their own lines, are the finest and the most harmonious
    which have ever been produced; on the other, the book-work turned out in the ordinary
    way of business by the five<span class="pagenum">xiv</span><a name="page_xiv"
    id="page_xiv"></a> or six leading printers of England and Scotland seems to me, both
    in technical qualities and in excellence of taste, the finest in the world, and with
    no rival worth mentioning, except in the work of one or two of the best firms in the
    United States. Moreover, as far as I can learn, it is only in Great Britain and
    America that the form of books is now the subject of the ceaseless experiment and
    ingenuity which are the signs of a period of artistic activity.</p>
    <p>As regards book-illustration the same claim may be put forward, though with a
    little more hesitation. We have been taught lately, with insistence, that 'the
    sixties' marked an epoch in English art, solely from the black and white work in
    illustrated books. At that period our book-pictures are said to have been the best in
    the world; unfortunately our book-decoration, whether better or worse than that of
    other countries, was almost unmitigatedly bad. In the last quarter of a century our
    decorative work has improved in the most striking manner; our illustrations, if
    judged merely for their pictorial qualities, have not advanced. In the eyes of
    artists the sketches for book-work now being produced in other countries are probably
    as good as our own. But an illustration is not merely<span
    class="pagenum">xv</span><a name="page_xv" id="page_xv"></a> a picture, it is a
    picture to be placed in a certain position in a printed book, and in due relation to
    the size of the page and the character of the type. English book-illustrators by no
    means always realise this distinction, yet there is on the whole a greater feeling
    for these proprieties in English books than in those of other countries, and this is
    an important point in estimating merits. Another important point is that the rule of
    the 'tint' or 'half-tone' block, with its inevitable accompaniment of loaded paper,
    ugly to the eye and heavy in the hand, though it has seriously damaged English
    illustrated work, has not yet gained the predominance it has in other countries. Our
    best illustrated books are printed from line-blocks, and there are even signs of a
    possible revival of artistic wood-engraving.</p>
    <p>In endeavouring to make good my assertion of what I have called the occasional
    primacy of English book-work, I am not unaware of the danger of trying, or seeming to
    try, to play the strains of 'Rule Britannia' on my own poor penny whistle. As regards
    manuscripts, therefore, it is a pleasure to be able to seek shelter behind the
    authority of Sir Edward Maunde Thompson, whose words in this connection carry all the
    more weight, because he has shown himself a<span class="pagenum">xvi</span><a
    name="page_xvi" id="page_xvi"></a> severe critic of the claims which have been put
    forward on behalf of several fine manuscripts to be regarded as English. In the
    closing paragraphs of his monograph on <i>English Illuminated Manuscripts</i> he thus
    sums up the pretensions of the English school:&mdash;</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>'The freehand drawing of our artists under the Anglo-Saxon kings was
      incomparably superior to the dead copies from Byzantine models which were in favour
      abroad. The artistic instinct was not destroyed, but rather strengthened, by the
      incoming of Norman influence; and of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries there is
      abundant material to show that English book-decoration was then at least equal to
      that of neighbouring countries. For our art of the early fourteenth century we
      claim a still higher position, and contend that no other nation could at that time
      produce such graceful drawing. Certainly inferior to this high standard of drawing
      was the work of the latter part of that century; but still, as we have seen, in the
      miniatures of this time we have examples of a rising school of painting which bid
      fair to attain to a high standard of excellence, and which only failed for
      political causes.'<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
    </div>
    <p>To this judicial pronouncement on the excellence of English manuscripts on their
    decorative side, we may fairly add the fact that manuscripts of literary importance
    begin at an earlier date in England than in any other country, and that the Cotton
    <span class="smcap">ms.</span> of <i>Beowulf</i> and the miscellanies which go by the
    names of the <i>Exeter Book</i> a<span class="pagenum">xvii</span><a name="page_xvii"
    id="page_xvii"></a>nd the <i>Vercelli Book</i> have no contemporary parallels in the
    rest of Europe.</p>

      Maunde Thompson, K. C. B. (Kegan Paul, 1895), pp. 66, 67.</p>
    </div>
    <p>When we turn from books, printed or in manuscript, to their possessors, it is only
    just to begin with a compliment to our neighbours across the Channel. No English
    bookman holds the unique position of Jean Grolier, and 'les femmes bibliophiles' of
    England have been few and undistinguished compared with those of France. Grolier,
    however, and his fair imitators, as a rule, bought only the books of their own day,
    giving them distinction by the handsome liveries which they made them don. Our
    English collectors have more often been of the omnivorous type, and though Lords
    Lumley and Arundel in the sixteenth century cannot, even when their forces are
    joined, stand up against De Thou, in Sir Robert Cotton, Harley, Thomas Rawlinson,
    Lord Spencer, Heber, Grenville, and Sir Thomas Phillips (and the list might be
    doubled without much relaxation of the standard), we have a succession of English
    collectors to whom it would be difficult to produce foreign counterparts. Round these
    <i>dii majores</i> have clustered innumerable demigods of the book-market, and
    certainly in no other country has collecting been as widely diffused, and pursued
    with so much zest, as in England during the<span class="pagenum">xviii</span><a
    name="page_xviii" id="page_xviii"></a> present century. It is to be regretted that so
    few English collectors have cared to leave their marks of ownership on the books they
    have taken so much pleasure in bringing together. Michael Wodhull was a model in this
    respect, for his book-stamp is one of the most pleasing of English origin, and his
    autograph notes recording the prices he paid for his treasures, and his assiduous
    collation of them, make them doubly precious in the eyes of subsequent owners. Mr.
    Grenville also had his book-stamp, though there is little joy to be won from it, for
    it is unpleasing in itself, and is too often found spoiling a fine old binding. Mr.
    Cracherode's stamp was as graceful as Wodhull's; but, as a rule, our English
    collectors, though, as Mr. Fletcher is discovering, many more of them than is
    generally known have possessed a stamp, have not often troubled to use it, and their
    collections have never obtained the reputation which they deserve, mainly for lack of
    marks of ownership to keep them green in the memory of later possessors. That this
    should be so in a country where book-plates have been so common may at first seem
    surprising. But book-plates everywhere have been used rather by the small collectors
    than the great ones, and the regrettable peculiarity of our English <span
    class="pagenum">xix</span><a name="page_xix" id="page_xix"></a>bookmen is, not that
    they despised this rather fugitive sign of possession, but that for the most part
    they despised book-stamps as well.</p>
    <p>Of book-plates themselves I have no claim to speak; but for good taste and grace
    of design the best English Jacobean and Chippendale specimens seem to me the most
    pleasing of their kind, and certainly in our own day the work of Mr. Sherborn has no
    rival, except in that of Mr. French, who, in technique, would, I imagine, not refuse
    to call himself his disciple.</p>
    <p>I have purposely left to the last the subject of Bindings, as this, being more
    immediately cognate to Mr. Davenport's book, may fairly be treated at rather greater
    length. If the French dictum 'la reliure est un art tout fran&ccedil;ais' is not
    without its historical justification, it is at least possible to show that England
    has done much admirable work, and that now and again, as in the other bookish arts,
    she has attained preeminence.</p>
    <p>The first point which may fairly be made is that England is the only country
    besides France in which the art has been consistently practised. In Italy, binding,
    like printing, flourished for a little over half a century with extraordinary
    vigour<span class="pagenum">xx</span><a name="page_xx" id="page_xx"></a> and grace,
    and then fell suddenly and completely from its high estate. From 1465 to the death of
    Aldus the books printed in Italy were the finest in the world; from the beginning of
    the work of Aldus to about 1560 Italian bindings possess a freedom of graceful design
    which even the superior technical skill quickly gained by the French does not
    altogether outbalance. But just as after about 1520 a finely printed Italian book can
    hardly be met with, so after 1560, save for a brief period during which certain
    fan-shaped designs attained prettiness, there have been no good Italian bindings. In
    Germany, when in the fifteenth century, before the introduction of gold tooling,
    there was a thriving school of binders working in the medi&aelig;val manner, the
    Renaissance brought with it an absolute decline. Holland, again, which in the
    fifteenth century had made a charming use of large panel stamps, has since that
    period had only two binders of any reputation, Magnus and Poncyn, of Amsterdam, who
    worked for the Elz&eacute;viers and Louis <span class="smcap">xiv</span>. Of Spanish
    bindings few fine specimens have been unearthed, and these are all early. Only
    England can boast that, like France, she has possessed one school of binders after
    another, working with varying success from the earliest times down to the present
    century, in which bookbinding all<span class="pagenum">xxi</span><a name="page_xxi"
    id="page_xxi"></a> over Europe has suffered from the servility with which the old
    designs, now for the first time fully appreciated, have been copied and imitated.</p>
    <p>In this length of pedigree it must be noted that England far surpasses even France
    herself. The magnificent illuminated manuscripts, the finest of their age, which were
    produced at Winchester during the tenth century, were no doubt bound in the jewelled
    metal covers of which the rapacity of the sixteenth century has left hardly a single
    trace in this country. But early in the twelfth century, if not before, the
    Winchester bookmen turned their attention also to leather binding, and the school of
    design which they started, spreading to Durham, London, and Oxford, did not die out
    in England until it was ousted by the large panel stamps introduced from France at
    the end of the fifteenth. The predominant feature of these Winchester bindings (of
    which a fine example from the library of William Morris recently sold for
    &pound;180), and of their successors, is the employment of small stamps, from half an
    inch to an inch in size, sometimes circular, more often square or pear-shaped, and
    containing figures, grotesques, or purely conventional designs. A circle, or two
    half-circles, formed by the repetition of one <span class="pagenum">xxii</span><a
    name="page_xxii" id="page_xxii"></a>stamp, within one or more rectangles formed by
    others, is perhaps the commonest scheme of decoration, but it is the characteristic
    of these bindings, as of the finest in gold tooling, that by the repetition of a few
    small patterns an endless variety of designs could be built up. The British Museum
    possesses a few good examples of this stamp-work, but the finest collections of them
    are in the Cathedral libraries at Durham and Hereford. Any one, however, who is
    interested in this work can easily acquaint himself with it by consulting the unique
    collection of rubbings carefully taken by Mr. Weale and deposited in the National Art
    Library at the South Kensington Museum. In these rubbings, as in no other way, the
    history of English binding can be studied from the earliest Winchester books to the
    charming Oxford bindings executed by Thomas Hunt, the English partner of the Cologne
    printer, Rood, about 1481.</p>
    <p>During the first half of this period the English leather binders were the finest
    in Europe; during the second, the Germans pressed them hard, and when the large panel
    stamps, three or four inches square and more, were introduced in Holland and France,
    the English adaptations of them were distinctly inferior to the originals. The
    earliest English bindings with gold tooling were, of<span
    class="pagenum">xxiii</span><a name="page_xxiii" id="page_xxiii"></a> course, also
    imitative. The use of gold reached this country but slowly, as the first known
    English binding, in which it occurs, is on a book printed in 1541, by which time the
    art had been common in Italy for a generation. The English bindings found on books
    bound for Henry <span class="smcap">viii.</span>, Edward <span
    class="smcap">vi.</span>, and Mary <span class="smcap">i.</span>, all of which are
    roughly assigned to Berthelet as the Royal binder, resemble the current Italian
    designs of the day, with sufficient differences to make it probable that they were
    produced by Englishmen. We know, however, that until the close of the century there
    were occasional complaints of the presence of foreign binders in London, and it is
    probable that the Grolieresque bindings executed for Wotton were foreign rather than
    English. Where, however, we find work on English books distinctly unlike anything in
    France or Italy, it is reasonable to assign it to a native school, and such a school
    seems to have grown up about 1570, in the workshop of John Day, the helper of
    Archbishop Parker in so many of his literary undertakings. These bindings attributed
    to Day, especially those in which he worked with white leather on brown, although
    they have none of the French delicacy of tooling, perhaps for this reason attack the
    problem of decoration with a greater<span class="pagenum">xxiv</span><a
    name="page_xxiv" id="page_xxiv"></a> sense of the difference between the styles
    suitable for a large book and a small than is always found in France, where the
    greatest binders, such as Nicholas Eve and Le Gascon, often covered large folios with
    endless repetitions of minute tools whose full beauty can only be appreciated on
    duodecimos or octavos. The English designs with a large centre ornament and
    corner-pieces are rich and impressive, and we may fairly give Day and his fellows the
    palm for originality and effectiveness among Elizabethan binders. In the next reign
    the French use of the sem&eacute; or powder, a single small stamp, of a fleur-de-lys,
    a thistle, a crown, or the like, impressed in rows all over the cover, was
    increasingly imitated in England, very unsuccessfully, and, save for a few traces of
    the style of Day, the leather bindings of the first third of the century deserve the
    worst epithets which can be given them.</p>
    <p>Until, however, French fashions came into vogue after the Restoration, English
    binders had never been content to regard leather as the sole material in which they
    could work. Embroidered bindings had come early into use in England, and a Psalter
    embroidered by Anne Felbrigge towards the close of the fourteenth century is
    preserved at the British Museum, and shown in one of Mr.<span
    class="pagenum">xxv</span><a name="page_xxv" id="page_xxv"></a> Davenport's
    illustrations. In the sixteenth century embroidered work was very popular with the
    Tudor princesses, gold and silver thread and pearls being largely used, often with
    very decorative effect. The simplest of these covers are also the best&mdash;but
    great elaboration was often employed, and on a presentation copy of Archbishop
    Parker's <i>De Antiquitate Ecclesi&aelig; Britannic&aelig;</i> we find a clever but
    rather grotesque representation of a deer-paddock. Under the Stuarts the lighter
    feather-stitch was preferred, and there seems to have been a regular trade in
    embroidered Bibles and Prayer-books of small size, sometimes with floral patterns,
    sometimes with portraits of the King, or Scriptural scenes. A dealer's freak which
    compelled the British Museum to buy a pair of elaborate gloves of the period rather
    than lose a finely embroidered Psalter, with which they went, was certainly a
    fortunate one, enabling us to realise that in hands thus gloved these little
    bindings, always pretty, often really artistic, must have looked exactly right, while
    their vivid colours must have been admirably in harmony with the gay Cavalier
    dresses.</p>
    <p>Besides furnishing a ground for embroidery, velvet bindings were often decorated,
    in England,<span class="pagenum">xxvi</span><a name="page_xxvi" id="page_xxvi"></a>
    with goldsmith work. One of the most beautiful little bookcovers in existence is on a
    book of prayers, bound for Queen Elizabeth in red velvet, with a centre and corner
    pieces delicately enamelled on gold. Under the Stuarts, again, we frequently find
    similar ornaments in engraved silver, and their charm is incontestable.</p>
    <p>Thus while for English bindings of this period in gilt leather we can only claim
    that Berthelet's show some freedom in their adaptation of Italian models, and Day's a
    more decided originality, we are entitled to set side by side with this scanty record
    a host of charming bindings in more feminine materials, which have no parallel in
    France, and certainly deserve some recognition. After the Restoration, however,
    leather quickly ousted its competitors, and a school of designers and gilders arose
    in England, which, while taking its first inspiration from Le Gascon, soon developed
    an individual style. In effectiveness, though not in minute accuracy of execution,
    this may rank with the best in Europe. We can trace the beginnings of this lighter
    and most graceful work as early as the thirties, and it might be contended with a
    certain plausibility that it began at the Universities. Certainly the two earliest
    examples known to me&mdash;the copy of her <i>Statutes</i> presented to Charles <span
    class="smcap">i.</span> by Oxford in 1634, and <span class="pagenum">xxvii</span><a
    name="page_xxvii" id="page_xxvii"></a>the Little Gidding <i>Harmony</i> of 1635, the
    tools employed in which have been shown by Mr. Davenport to have been used also by
    Buck, of Cambridge&mdash;are two of the finest English bindings in existence, and in
    both cases, despite the multiplicity of the tiny tools employed, there is a unity and
    largeness of design which, as I have ventured to hint, is not always found even in
    the best French work. The chief English bindings after the Restoration, those
    associated with the name of Samuel Mearne, the King's Binder, preserve this
    character, though the attempt to break the formality of the rectangle by the bulges
    at the side and the little penthouses at foot and head (whence its name, the
    'cottage' style) was not wholly successful. The use of the labour-saving device of
    the 'roll,' in preference to impressing each section of the pattern by hand, is
    another blot. Nevertheless, it is almost impossible to find an English or Scotch
    binding of this period which is less than charming, and the best of them are
    admirable. At the beginning of the eighteenth century a new grace was added by the
    inlaying of a leather of a second colour. These inlaid English bindings are few in
    number (the British Museum has not a single fine example), but those who know the
    specimens exhibited at the Burlington Fine Arts Club, two of which are<span
    class="pagenum">xxviii</span><a name="page_xxviii" id="page_xxviii"></a> figured in
    its Catalogue, will readily allow that their grace has never been surpassed. The fine
    Harleian bindings let us down gently from this eminence, and then, after a period of
    mere dulness, with the rise of Roger Payne we have again an English school (for
    Payne's traditions were worthily followed by Charles Lewis) which, by common consent,
    was the finest of its time. Payne's originality is, perhaps, not quite so absolute as
    has been maintained, for some of his tools were cut in the pattern of Mearne's, and
    it would be possible to find suggestions for some of his schemes of arrangement in
    earlier English work. If he borrowed, however, he borrowed from his English
    predecessors, and he brought to his task an individuality and an artistic instinct
    which cannot be denied.</p>
    <p>After Payne and Lewis, English binding, like French, became purely imitative in
    its designs; but while in our own decade the French artists have endeavoured to shake
    themselves free from old traditions by mere eccentricity, in England we have several
    living binders, such as Mr. Cobden Sanderson and Mr. Douglas Cockerell, who work with
    notable originality and yet with the strictest observance of the canons of their
    art.<span class="pagenum">xxix</span><a name="page_xxix" id="page_xxix"></a></p>
    <p>Moreover in the application of decorative designs to cloth cases England has
    invented, and England and America have brought to perfection, an inexpensive and very
    pleasing form of book-cover, which gives the bookman ample time to consider whether
    his purchase is worth the more permanent honours of gilded leather, and also, by the
    facts that it is avowedly temporary, and that its decoration is cheaply and easily
    effected by large stamps, renders forgivable vagaries of design, which when
    translated, as they have been of late years in France, into the time-honoured and
    solemn leather, seem merely incongruous and irreverent.</p>
    <p>In binding, then, as in the other bookish arts, the part which English workers
    have played has been no insignificant or unworthy one, and the development of this
    art, as of the others, in our own country is worthy of study. In this case much has
    already been done, for the illustrations of <i>English Bookbindings at the British
    Museum</i>, edited, with introduction and descriptions by Mr. W. Y. Fletcher, present
    the student with the best possible survey of the whole subject, while the excellent
    treatises of Miss Prideaux and Mr. Horne bring English bookbinding into relation with
    that of other countries. Here, then, there is no need of a new general history, but
    rather o<span class="pagenum">xxx</span><a name="page_xxx" id="page_xxx"></a>f
    special monographs, treating more in detail of the periods at which our English
    binders have done the best work. The old stamped bindings of the days of manuscript,
    the embroidered bindings of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the leather
    bindings of Mearne and his fellows under the later Stuarts, and the work of Roger
    Payne&mdash;all these seem to offer excellent subjects for unpretentious monographs,
    and it is hoped that others of them besides the <i>English Embroidered Bindings</i>,
    with which Mr. Davenport has made a beginning, may be treated in this series.</p>
    <p>In other subjects the ground has not yet been cleared to the same extent, and for
    the history of English Book-Collectors and English Printing, not special monographs,
    but good general surveys are the first need. To say much on this subject might bring
    me perilously near to re-writing the prospectus of this series. It is enough to have
    pointed out that the bookish arts in England are well worth more study than they have
    yet been given, and that the pioneers who are endeavouring to enlarge knowledge, each
    in his own section, may fairly hope that their efforts will be received with
    indulgence and good-will.</p>

    <p>he application of needlework to the embellishment of the bindings of books has
    hitherto almost escaped special notice. In most of the works on the subject of
    English Bookbinding, considered from the decorative point of view in distinction from
    the technical, a few examples of embroidered covers have indeed received some share
    of attention. Thus in both Mr. H. B. Wheatley's and Mr. W. Y. Fletcher's works on the
    bindings in the British Museum, in Mr. Salt Brassington's <i>Historic Bindings in the
    Bodleian Library</i> and <i>History of the Art of Bookbinding</i>, and in my own
    <i>Portfolio</i> monograph on 'Royal English Bookbindings,' some of the finer
    specimens of embroidered books still existing are illustrated and described. But up
    to the present no attempt has been made to deal with them as a separate subject. In
    the course, however, of the many lectures on Decorative Bookbinding which it has been
    my pleasure and honour to deliver during <span class="pagenum">2</span><a
    name="page_2" id="page_2"></a>the past few years, I have invariably noticed that the
    pictures and descriptions of embroidered specimens have been the most keenly
    appreciated, and this favourable sign has led me to examine and consider such
    examples as have come in my way more carefully than I might otherwise have done. Very
    little study sufficed to show that in England alone there was for a considerable
    period a regular and large production of embroidered books, and further, that the
    different styles of these embroideries are clearly defined, equally from the
    chronological and artistic points of view. A peculiarly English art which thus lends
    itself to orderly treatment may fairly be made the subject of a brief monograph.</p>
    <p>With the exception of point-lace, which is sometimes made in small pieces for such
    purposes as ladies' cuffs or collars, decorative work produced by the aid of the
    needle is generally large. Certainly this is so in its finest forms, which are
    probably to be found in the ecclesiastical vestments and in the altar frontals of the
    Renaissance period, or even earlier. On the other hand, such work as exists on books
    is always of small size, and, unlike the point-lace, it almost invariably has more
    than one kind of 'stitchery' upon it&mdash;chain, split, tapestry, satin, or what
    not.</p>
    <p>Thus it can be claimed as a distinction for embroidered book-covers that as a
    class they are the smallest complete embroideries existing, <span
    class="pagenum">3</span><a name="page_3" id="page_3"></a>ranging upwards from about 6
    inches by 3&frac12; inches&mdash;the size of the smallest specimen known to me, when
    opened out to its fullest extent, sides and back in one. This covers a copy of the
    Psalms, printed in London in 1635, and is of white satin, with a small tulip worked
    in coloured silk on each side.</p>
    <p>An 'Embroidered Book,' it should be said, means for my purpose a book which is
    covered, sides and back, by a piece of material ornamented with needlework, following
    a design made for the purpose of adorning that particular book. A cover consisting of
    merely a piece of woven stuff, or even a piece of true embroidery cut from a larger
    piece, is not, from my point of view, properly to be considered an 'embroidered
    book,' it being essential that the design as well as the workmanship should have been
    specially made for the book on which they are found; and this, in the large majority
    of instances, is certainly the case.</p>
    <p>With regard to the transference of bindings to books other than those for which
    they were originally made, such a transference has often taken place in the case of
    medi&aelig;val books bound in ornamental metal, but even in these instances it must
    be recognised that such a change can seldom be made without serious detriment. It is
    chiefly indeed from some incongruity of style or technical mistake in the re-putting
    together that we are led to guess that the covers have been <span
    class="pagenum">4</span><a name="page_4" id="page_4"></a>thus tampered with. Now and
    then such a transference occurs in the case of leather-bound books, and in such
    instances is usually easy for a trained binder to detect. Embroidered covers, on the
    other hand, have rarely been changed, the motive for such a proceeding never having
    been strong, and the risk attending it being obvious enough. We may, in fact, feel
    tolerably sure that the large majority of embroidered covers still remain on the
    boards of the books they were originally made for.</p>
    <p>All the embroidered books now extant dating from before the reign of Queen
    Elizabeth have gone through the very unfortunate operation of 're-backing,' in the
    course of which the old embroidered work is replaced by new leather. The old head and
    tail bands, technically very interesting, have been replaced by modern imitations,
    and considerable damage has been done in distorting the work left on the sides of the
    book. It would seem obvious that a canvas, velvet, or satin embroidered binding, if
    it really must be re-backed or repaired at all, should be mended with a material as
    nearly as possible of the same make and colour as that of the original covering; but
    this has rarely been done, the large majority of such repairs being executed in
    leather. But in the case of such old bindings we must be grateful for small mercies,
    and feel thankful that even the sides are left in so many cases. It is<span
    class="pagenum">5</span><a name="page_5" id="page_5"></a> indeed surprising that we
    still possess as much as we do. If all our great collectors had been of the same mind
    as Henry Prince of Wales, the Right Hon. Thomas Grenville, or even King George <span
    class="smcap">iii.</span>, we should have been far worse off, as although several
    fine old bindings exist in their libraries, many which would now be priceless have
    been destroyed, only to be replaced by comparatively modern bindings, sometimes the
    best of their kind, but often in bad taste.</p>
    <div class="subchap">
      <i>Division of Embroidered Books according to the designs upon them.</i>
    </div>
    <p>The designs on embroidered books may be roughly divided into four
    classes&mdash;Heraldic, Figure, Floral, and Arabesque.</p>
    <p>The Heraldic designs always denote ownership, and are most frequently found on
    Royal books bound in velvet, rarely occurring on silk or satin, and never, as far as
    I have been able to ascertain, on canvas. The Figure designs may be subdivided into
    three smaller classes, viz.:&mdash;</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <span class="smcap">i.</span> Scriptural, <i>e.g.</i> representations of Solomon
      and the Queen of Sheba, Jacob wrestling with the Angel, David, etc.<br />
    </div>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <span class="smcap">ii.</span> Symbolical, <i>e.g.</i> figures of Faith, Hope,
      Peace, Plenty, etc.<br />
    </div>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <span class="smcap">iii.</span> Portraits, <i>e.g.</i> of Charles <span
      class="smcap">i.</span>, Queen Henrietta Maria, Duke of Buckingham, etc.<br />
    </div>
    <span class="pagenum">6</span><a name="page_6" id="page_6"></a>
    <p>The Scriptural designs are most generally found on canvas-bound books; the
    Symbolical figures, and Portraits, on satin, rarely on velvet. The Floral and
    Arabesque designs are most common on small and unimportant works bound in satin, but
    they occur now and then on both canvas and velvet books. The true arabesques have no
    animal or insect forms among them, the prophet Mohammed having forbidden his
    followers to imitate any living thing.</p>
    <p>It may further be noted that heraldic designs on embroidered books are early,
    having been made chiefly during the sixteenth century, and that the figure, floral,
    and arabesque designs most usually belong to the seventeenth century. There are, of
    course, exceptions to these divisions, notably in the case of the earliest existing
    embroidered book, which has figure designs on both sides, but also maintains its
    heraldic position, inasmuch as its edges are decorated with coats-of-arms.</p>
    <p>Naturally, again, it may be sometimes difficult to decide whether a design should
    be classed as heraldic or floral. Such a difficulty occurs as to the large Bible at
    Oxford bound in red velvet for Queen Elizabeth, and bearing a design of Tudor and
    York roses. I consider it heraldic, but it might, with no less appropriateness, be
    called floral. If it had belonged to any one not a member of the Royal family it
    would undoubtedly be properly counted as a floral specimen. Again, <span
    class="pagenum">7</span><a name="page_7" id="page_7"></a>in many of the portrait
    bindings flowers and arabesques are introduced, but they are clearly subordinate, and
    the chief decorative motive of such designs must be looked for, and the work classed
    accordingly. Thus it is evident that the arrangement of the embroidered books by
    their designs cannot be too rigidly applied, although it should not be lost sight of
    altogether.</p>
    <div class="subchap">
      <i>Division of Embroidered Books according to the material on which they are
      worked.</i>
    </div>
    <p>A more useful and accurate classification may however be found by help of the
    material on which the embroidered work is done, and this division is obvious and
    easy. With very few exceptions all embroidered books, ancient and modern, are worked
    on <i>canvas</i>, <i>velvet</i>, or <i>satin</i>, and while canvas was used
    continuously from the fourteenth century until the middle of the seventeenth century,
    velvet was most largely used during the Tudor period, and satin during that of the
    early Stuarts.</p>
    <p>Broadly speaking, the essential differences in the kind of work found upon these
    three materials follow the peculiarities of the materials themselves. Canvas, in
    itself of no decorative value, is always completely covered with needlework. Velvet,
    beautiful even when alone, but difficult to work upon, usually has a large proportion
    <span class="pagenum">8</span><a name="page_8" id="page_8"></a>of appliqu&eacute;,
    laid, or couched work, in coloured silk or satin, upon it, showing always large
    spaces unworked upon, and such actual work as occurs directly on the velvet is always
    in thick guimp or gold cord. Satin, equally beautiful in its way, is also freely left
    unornamented in places; the needlework directly upon it is often very fine and
    delicate in coloured floss silks, generally closely protected by thick raised frames
    or edges of metallic threads or fine gold or silver cords.</p>

    <p>By 'metallic' threads, when they are not simply fine wires, I mean strands of silk
    closely (Fig. 1) or loosely (Fig. 2) wound round with narrow coils of thin metal,
    mostly silver or silver gilt. The use of such threads, alone, or twisted into cords,
    is common on all styles of embroidered books, and it is largely due to their use that
    pieces of work apparently of the greatest delicacy are really extremely
    durable&mdash;far more <span class="pagenum">9</span><a name="page_9"
    id="page_9"></a>so than is generally supposed. Certainly if it had not been for the
    efficient protection of these little metal walls we should not possess, as we
    actually do, delicate-looking embroidered books, hundreds of years old, in almost as
    good condition, except in the matter of colour, as when they were originally
    made.</p>
    <p>Thin pieces of metal are sometimes used alone, caught down at regular intervals by
    small cross stitches; this is, I believe, called 'Lizzarding' (Fig. 3). Metal is also
    found in the form of 'guimp,' in flattened spirals (Fig. 4), and also in the 'Purl,'
    or copper wire covered with silk (Fig. 5), so common on the later satin books
    (compare p. 46).</p>

    <p>It may be mentioned that the seventeenth-century Dutch binders, Magnus and Poncyn,
    both of Amsterdam, invented a new tool for gilding on leather bindings, used, of
    course, in combination with others. This was cut to imitate the small circular
    spangles of the embroidered books (Fig. 8), and the English and French finishers of a
    later period used the same device with excellent effect for filling up obtrusive
    spaces on the sides and backs of their decorative bindings. Thus it may be taken as
    an axiom that, for the proper working of an embroidered book, except it be
    tapestry-stitch or tent-stitch, on canvas, which is flat and strong of itself, there
    should invariably be a liberal use of metal threads, these being not only very
    decorative in themselves, but also providing a valuable protection to the more
    delicate needlework at a lower level, and to the material of the ground itself.</p>
    <p>The earliest examples of embroidered bindings still existing are not by any means
    such as would lead to the inference that they were exceptional productions&mdash;made
    when the idea of the application <span class="pagenum">11</span><a name="page_11"
    id="page_11"></a>of needlework to the decoration of books was in its infancy. On the
    contrary, they are instances of very skilled workmanship, so that it is probable that
    the art was practised at an earlier date than we now have recorded. There are,
    indeed, frequent notes in 'Wardrobe Accounts' and elsewhere of books bound in velvet
    and satin at a date anterior to any now existing, but there is no mention of
    embroidered work upon them.</p>
    <div class="subchap">
      <i>The Forwarding of Embroidered Books.</i>
    </div>
    <p>The processes used in the binding of embroidered books are the same as in the case
    of leather-bound books; but there is one invariable peculiarity&mdash;the bands upon
    which the different sections of the paper are sewn are never in relief, so that it
    was always possible to paste down a piece of material easily along the back without
    having to allow for the projecting bands so familiar on leather bindings (Fig. 9).
    The backs, moreover, are only rounded very slightly, if at all.</p>
    <p>This flatness has been attained on the earlier books either by sewing on flat
    bands, thin strips of leather or vellum (Fig. 10), or by flattening the usual hempen
    bands as much as they will bear by the hammer, and afterwards filling up the
    intermediate spaces with padding of some suitable material, linen or thin
    leather.</p>
    <p>In several instances the difficulty of flattening the bands has been solved, in
    sixteenth- and<span class="pagenum">12</span><a name="page_12" id="page_12"></a>
    seventeenth-century embroidered books, in a way which cannot be too strongly
    condemned from a constructive point of view, although it has served its immediate
    purpose admirably.</p>
    <p>A small trench has been cut with a sharp knife for each band, deep enough to sink
    it to the general level of the inner edges of the sections (Fig. 11).</p>

    <p>The existence of the sunken bands on early embroidered books probably marks the
    beginning of <span class="pagenum">13</span><a name="page_13" id="page_13"></a>this
    vicious system, but here there is some excuse for it, whereas in the case of ordinary
    leather-bound books there is none, except from the commercial standpoint.</p>
    <p>In the case of vellum books there may be some reason for using the 'sawn in'
    bands, as it is certainly difficult to get vellum to fit comfortably over raised
    bands, although numerous early instances exist in which it has been successfully
    done. Again in the case of 'hollow backs,' the bands are kept flat with some reason.
    But for all valuable or finely bound books the system of 'sawing in' cannot be too
    strongly condemned.</p>
    <p>'Sawing in' can be detected by looking at the threads in the centre of any section
    of a bound book from the inside. It will show as a small hole with a piece of hemp or

    from the inside of the sections, unless, indeed, the book is damaged (Fig. 13). If
    the covering of the back is off, or even loose, the method of sewing that has been
    used can very easily be seen; and if it appears that the bands are sunk in a small
    trench, that is the form of sewing that is called 'sawn in,' or analogous to it.</p>

    <p>Although in the embroidered books the bands of the backs do not show on the
    surface, it is common enough to find the lines they probably follow indicated in the
    work on the back, which is divided into panels by as many transverse lines, braid or
    cord, as there are bands underneath them. But in some cases the designer has used the
    back as one long panel, and decorated <span class="pagenum">15</span><a
    name="page_15" id="page_15"></a>it accordingly as one space. The headbands in some of
    the earlier books were sewn at the same time as the other bands on the sewing-press
    and drawn in to the boards, but in most early bindings the ravaging repairer has been
    at work and made it impossible to know for certain what was the state of the
    headbands before the book came into his hands. Most of the existing headbands are
    made by hand in the usual way, with the ends simply cut off, not indeed a very
    satisfactory finish. It would be better if these ends were somehow drawn in to the
    leather of the back, as for instance they still often are on thin vellum books.</p>
    <p>The great majority of embroidered books, both large and small, have had ties of
    silk on their front edges&mdash;generally two, but sometimes only one, which wraps
    round. These ties have generally worn away from the outer side of the boards, but
    their ends can usually be traced (if the book has not been repaired) in the inner
    side, covered only by a thin piece of paper; and if this paper is loose, as often
    happens, and the ends show well, it may often be advisable not to paste it down again
    at that particular place.</p>
    <p>The backs of old embroidered books are by far the weakest parts about them. If
    they exist at all in their old forms they are always much worn, and the work upon
    them so much damaged that it is often difficult to make out even the <span
    class="pagenum">16</span><a name="page_16" id="page_16"></a>general character of the
    design, to say nothing of the details of the workmanship.</p>
    <p>The edges of the leaves of books bound in England in embroidered bindings are
    always ornamentally treated, sometimes simply gilded, often further adorned with
    'gauffred' work, that is to say, small patterns impressed on the gold, and sometimes
    beautifully decorated with elaborate designs having colour in parts as well. The
    earliest English ornamentation of this kind in colour is found on the Felbrigge
    Psalter and on some of the books embroidered for Henry <span
    class="smcap">viii.</span>, one of which is richly painted on the fore edges with
    heraldic designs, and another with a motto written in gold on a delicately coloured
    ground.</p>

      <i>Cases for Embroidered Books.</i>
    </div>
    <p>Common though the small satin embroidered books must have been in England during
    the earlier part of the seventeenth century, it is still certain that the finer
    specimens were highly prized, and beautifully worked bags were often made for their
    protection. These bags are always of canvas, and most of them are decorated in the
    same way, the backgrounds of silver thread with a design in tapestry-or tent-stitch,
    and having ornamental strings and tassels. To describe one of these is almost to
    describe all. The best preserved specimen I know belongs to a little satin
    embroidered <span class="pagenum">17</span><a name="page_17" id="page_17"></a>copy of
    the Psalms, printed in London in 1633, and measures 5 inches long by 4 inches in
    depth.</p>

      <p class="caption">1&mdash;Embroidered Bag for Psalms. London, 1633.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The same design is repeated on each side. A parrot on a small grass-plot is in the
    middle of the lower edge. Behind the bird grow two curving stems of thick gold braid,
    each curve containing a beautifully-worked flower or fruit. In the centre is a
    carnation, and round it are arranged consecutively a bunch of grapes, a pansy, a
    honeysuckle, and a double rose, green leaves occurring at intervals. From the lower
    edge depend three ornamental tassels of silver loops, with small acorns in silver and
    coloured silks, one from the centre and one from each corner.</p>
    <p>The top edge has two draw-strings of gold and red braid, each ending in an
    ornamental oval acorn of silver thread and coloured silks, probably worked on canvas
    over a wooden core, ending in a tassel similar to those on the lower edge.</p>
    <p>A long loop of gold and silver braid serves as a handle, or means of attachment to
    a belt, and is fixed at each side near a strong double loop of silver thread, used
    when pulling the bag open. The lining is of pink silk. This particular bag is perfect
    in colour as well as condition, but usually the silver has turned black, or nearly
    so. Besides these very ornamental bags, others of quite simple workmanship are
    occasionally found, worked in outline with coloured silks. As well as the embroidered
    bags, certain rectangular cloths <span class="pagenum">18</span><a name="page_18"
    id="page_18"></a>variously ornamented, some richly, some plainly, were made and used
    for the protection of embroidered books, when being read. These, like the bags, only
    seem to have been used during the seventeenth century. A particularly fine example
    belongs to a New Testament bound in embroidered satin in 1640. It is of fine linen,
    measuring 16&frac12; by 9&frac14; inches, and is beautifully embroidered in a floral
    design, with thick stalks of gold braid arranged in curves and bearing conventional
    flowers and leaves, all worked in needle-point lace with coloured silks in a
    wonderfully skilful manner.</p>
    <p>In the centre is a double red rose with separate petals, and among the other
    flowers are corn-flowers, honeysuckles, carnations, strawberries, and several leaves,
    all worked in the same way, and appliqu&eacute;s at their edges. Some, however, of
    the larger leaves and petals are ornamentally fastened down to the linen by small
    coloured stitches arranged in lines or patterns over their surfaces, as well as by
    the edge stitches. There are several spangles scattered about in the spaces on the
    linen, and the edge is bound with green silk and gold. On the book itself to which
    this cover belongs there is a good deal of the same needle-point work, probably
    executed by the same hand; but the cover is a finer piece altogether than the
    book,&mdash;in fact it is the finest example of such work I have ever seen.</p>

    <p>Abroad there have been made at various times embroidered bindings for books, but
    in no country except England has there been any regular production of them. I have
    come across a few cases in England of foreign work, the most important of which I
    will shortly describe. In the British Museum is an interesting specimen bound in red
    satin, and embroidered with the arms of Felice Peretti, Cardinal de Montalt, who was
    afterwards Pope Sixtus <span class="smcap">v.</span>; the coat-of-arms has a little
    coloured silk upon it, but the border and the cardinal's hat with tassels are all
    outlined in gold cord. The work is of an elementary character. The book itself is a
    beautiful illuminated vellum copy of Fichet's <i>Rhetoric</i>, printed in Paris in
    1471, and presented to the then Pope, Sixtus <span class="smcap">iv.</span> In the
    same collection are a few more instances of Italian embroidered bindings, always
    heraldic in their main designs, the workmanship not being of any particular
    excellence or character. Perhaps altogether the most interesting Italian work of this
    kind was done on books bound for Cardinal York, several of which still remain,
    embroidered with his coat-of-arms, one of them being now in the Royal Library at
    Windsor. Although the actual workmanship on these books is foreign, we may perhaps
    claim them as having been suggested or made by the order of the English Prince
    himself, inheriting the liking for embroidered books from his Stuart ancestors.</p>
    <span class="pagenum">20</span><a name="page_20" id="page_20"></a>
    <p>French embroidered books are very rare, and I do not know of any examples in
    England. Two interesting specimens, at least, are in the Biblioth&egrave;que
    Nationale, and are described and figured in Bouchot's work on the artistic bindings
    in that library. The earlier is on a book of prayers of the fifteenth century, bound
    in canvas, and worked with 'tapisserie de soie au petit point,' or as I should call
    it, tent-, or tapestry-, stitch. It represents the Crucifixion and a saint, but M.
    Bouchot remarks of it, 'La composition est grossi&egrave;re et les figures des plus
    rudimentaires.'</p>
    <p>The other instance occurs on a sixteenth-century manuscript, 'Les Gestes de
    Blanche de Castille.' It is bound in black velvet, much worn, and ornamented with
    appliqu&eacute; embroideries in coloured silks, in shading stitch, probably done on
    fine linen. The design on the upper cover shows the author of the book, Etienne le
    Blanc, in the left-hand corner, kneeling at the feet of Louise de Savoie, Regent of
    France, to whom the book is dedicated. Near her is a fountain into which an antlered
    stag is jumping, pursued by three hounds.</p>
    <p>The Dutch, in the numerous excellent styles of bindings they have so freely
    imitated from other nations, have not failed to include the English embroidered
    books. In the South Kensington Museum is a charming specimen of their work on satin,
    finely worked in coloured <span class="pagenum">21</span><a name="page_21"
    id="page_21"></a>silks with small masses of pearls in a rather too elaborate design
    of flowers and animals. In the British Museum, besides other instances of Dutch
    needlework, there is a very handsome volume of the <i>Acta Synodalis Nationalis
    Dordrechti habit&aelig;</i>, printed at Leyden in 1620, and bound in crimson velvet.
    It has the royal coat-of-arms of England within the Garter, with crest, supporters,
    and motto, all worked in various kinds of gold thread; in the corners are sprays of
    roses and thistles alternately, and above and below the coat are the crowned initials
    J. R., all worked in gold thread.</p>
    <div class="subchap">
      <i>Hints for Modern Broiderers.</i>
    </div>
    <p>Many book-covers have been embroidered during the last few years in England by
    ladies working on their own account, or by some of the students at one or other of
    the many excellent centres now existing for the study and practice of the fascinating
    art of bookbinding.</p>
    <p>Although a large proportion of modern work of this kind has been only copied from
    older work, I see no reason why original designs should not be freely and
    successfully invented. But I think that the ancient work may be advantageously
    studied and carefully copied as far as choice of threads and manner of working them
    goes. The workers of our old embroidered books were <span class="pagenum">22</span><a
    name="page_22" id="page_22"></a>people of great skill and large experience, and from
    a long and careful examination of much of their work, I am impressed with the
    conviction that they worked on definite principles. If I allude briefly to some of
    these I may perhaps give intending workwomen a hint or two as to some minor points
    which may assist their work to show to the best advantage when <i>in situ</i>, and
    also insure, as far as possible, that it will not be unduly damaged during the
    operation of fixing to the back and boards of the book for which it is intended.</p>
    <p>(1) Before the operation of fixing on the book is begun, it will always be found
    best to mount the embroidered work on a backing of strong fine linen. The stage at
    which it is best to add the linen will vary according to the kind of work it is to
    strengthen. In the case of canvas it will only be necessary to tack it on quite at
    the last; with velvet a backing from the first may be used with advantage, all the
    stitches being taken through both materials. As to satin, it will be best to do all
    the very fine work, if any, in coloured silks first, and when the stronger work in
    cord or braid comes on, the linen may be then added. The value of the linen is
    twofold: it strengthens the entire work and protects the finer material from the
    paste with which it is ultimately fastened on to the book.</p>
    <p>(2) A book must be sewn, the edges cut, and <span class="pagenum">23</span><a
    name="page_23" id="page_23"></a>the boards fixed, before the sizes of the sides and
    back can be accurately measured. These sizes must be given to the designer most
    carefully, as a very small difference between the real size and the embroidered size
    will entirely spoil the finished effect, however fine the details of the workmanship
    may be. When the exact size is known the designer will fill the spaces at his
    disposal according to his taste and skill, making his sketches on paper, and, when
    these are complete, transferring the outlines to the material on which the work is to
    be done. If the designer is also to be the worker it is artistically right, and he,
    or she, will put in the proper stitches as the work progresses; but if another person
    is to execute the needlework it will be best that very detailed description of all
    the threads and stitches that are to be used should be given, as every designer of an
    embroidery design intends it to be carried out in a particular way, and unless this
    way is followed, the design does not have full justice done to it.</p>
    <p>(3) In the working itself the greatest care must be taken, especially as to two
    points: the first and perhaps the more important, because the more difficult to
    remedy, is that the needlework on the <i>under</i> side of the material must be as
    small and flat as possible, and all knots, lumps, or irregularities here, if they
    cannot be avoided or safely cut off, had best be brought to the upper side and <span
    class="pagenum">24</span><a name="page_24" id="page_24"></a>worked over. With satin,
    especially, attention to this point is most necessary, as unless the plain spaces lie
    quite flat, which they are very apt not to do, the proper appearance of the finished
    work is spoiled, and however good it may be in all other points, can never be
    considered first-rate.</p>
    <p>The second pitfall to avoid is any pulling or straining of the material during the
    operation of embroidering it. Success in avoiding this depends primarily upon the
    various threads being drawn at each stitch to the proper tension, so that it may just
    have the proper pull to keep it in its place and no more&mdash;and although a stitch
    too loose is bad enough, one too tight is infinitely worse.</p>
    <p>(4) The preponderance of appliqu&eacute; work, and raised work in metal guimps on
    embroidered books, especially on velvet, is easily accounted for when the principles
    they illustrate are understood, the truth being that in both these operations the
    maximum of surface effect is produced with the minimum of under work.</p>
    <p>If the piece appliqu&eacute; is not very large, a series of small stitches along
    all the edges is generally enough to keep it firm; such edge stitches are in most
    cases afterwards masked by a gold cord laid over them. If, however, the
    appliqu&eacute; piece is large it will be necessary to fix it as well with some
    supplementary stitches through the central portions. These stitches will generally be
    so <span class="pagenum">25</span><a name="page_25" id="page_25"></a>managed that
    they fit in with, or under, some of the ornamental work; at the same time, if
    necessary, they may be symmetrically arranged so as to become themselves of a
    decorative character.</p>
    <div class="subchap">
      <i>The Embroidered Books here illustrated.</i>
    </div>
    <p>For the purposes of illustration I have chosen the most typical specimens possible
    from such collections as I have had access to. The chief collections in England are,
    undoubtedly, those at the British Museum and at the Bodleian Library at Oxford. The
    collection at the British Museum is especially rich, the earlier and finer specimens
    almost invariably having formed part of the old Royal Library of England given by
    George <span class="smcap">ii.</span> to the Museum in 1757.</p>
    <p>The more recent specimens have been acquired either by purchase or donation, but
    as there has been no special intention at any time to collect these bindings, it is
    remarkable that such a number of them exist in our National Library. The Bodleian is
    rich in a few fine specimens only, and most of these are exhibited. My illustrations
    are made from photographs from the books themselves in all instances; to show them
    properly, however, all should be in colour, and it should not be forgotten that an
    embroidered book represented only by a half-tint print, however good, inevitably
    loses its <span class="pagenum">26</span><a name="page_26" id="page_26"></a>greatest
    charm. However, if the half-tint is unworthy, the colour prints are distinctly
    flattering. I think that almost any old book well reproduced in colour gains in
    appearance, and in two of my colour plates I have actually restored some parts. In
    the beautiful fourteenth century psalter, supposed to have been worked by Anne de
    Felbrigge, I have made the colours purposely much clearer than they are at present.
    If it were possible to clean this volume, the colours would show very nearly as they
    do on my plate; but, actually, they are all much darker and more indistinct, being in
    fact overlaid with the accumulated dirt of centuries. The other instance where I have
    added more than at present exists on the original is the green velvet book which
    belonged to Queen Elizabeth, and forms my frontispiece. Here I have put in the
    missing pearls, each of which has left its little impression on the velvet, so
    nothing is added for which there is not the fullest authority. Moreover, some of the
    gold cord is gone on each of the three volumes of this work, but I have put it in its
    proper place for the purpose of illustration. The other plates are not in any way
    materially altered, but it may be allowed that the colour plates show their originals
    at their best.</p>
    <p>The books illustrated are selected out of a large number, and I think it may
    fairly be considered that the most favourable typical specimens now left in England
    are shown. It may well be <span class="pagenum">27</span><a name="page_27"
    id="page_27"></a>that a few finer instances than I have been able to find may still
    be discovered hidden away in private collections, but it is now so rarely that a
    really fine ancient embroidered book comes into the sale-room, that we may safely
    conclude the best of them are already safely housed in one or other of our great
    national collections. Where not otherwise stated, the specimens described are in the
    British Museum.</p>
    <p>In the following detailed descriptions I have used the words 'sides' and 'boards'
    to mean the same thing, and the measurements refer to the size of the boards
    themselves, not including the back. These measurements must be taken as approximate
    only, as from wear and other causes the actual sizes would only be truly given by the
    use of small fractions of inches.</p>

    <p>nglish books bound in embroidered canvas range over a period of about two hundred
    and fifty years, the earliest known specimen dating from the fourteenth century, and
    instances of the work occurring with some frequency from this time until the middle
    of the seventeenth century. The majority of these bindings are worked in
    tapestry-stitch, or tent-stitch, in designs illustrating Scriptural subjects in
    differently coloured threads.</p>
    <p>Very often the outlines of these designs are marked by gold threads and cords, of
    various kinds, and parts of the work are also frequently enriched with further work
    upon them in metal threads. Spangles are very rarely found on canvas-bound books. The
    backgrounds of several of the later specimens are worked in silver threads, sometimes
    in chain-stitch and sometimes in tapestry-stitch; others again have the groundwork
    <span class="pagenum">29</span><a name="page_29" id="page_29"></a> of silver threads
    laid along the surface of the canvas and caught down at regular intervals by small
    stitches&mdash;this kind of work is called 'laid' or 'couched' work. Books bound with
    this metal ground have always strong work superimposed, usually executed in metal
    strips, cords, and thread. The silver is now generally oxidised and much darkened,
    but when new these bindings must have been very brilliant.</p>

      <p class="caption">3&mdash;The Felbrigge Psalter. 13th-century MS.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The earliest example of an embroidered book in existence is, I believe, the
    manuscript English Psalter written in the thirteenth century, which afterwards
    belonged to Anne, daughter of Sir Simon de Felbrigge, K. G., standard-bearer to
    Richard <span class="smcap">ii</span>. Anne de Felbrigge was a nun in the convent of
    Minoresses at Bruisyard in Suffolk, during the latter half of the fourteenth century,
    and it is quite likely that she herself worked the cover&mdash;such work having
    probably been largely done in monasteries and convents during the middle ages.</p>
    <p>On the upper side is a very charming design of the Annunciation, and, on the
    under, another of the Crucifixion, each measuring 7&frac34; by 5&frac34; inches. In
    both cases the ground is worked with fine gold threads 'couched' in a zigzag pattern,
    the rest of <span class="pagenum">30</span><a name="page_30" id="page_30"></a>the
    work being very finely executed in split-stitch by the use of which apparently
    continuous lines can be made, each successive stitch beginning a little <i>within</i>
    that immediately preceding it&mdash;the effect in some places being that of a very
    fine chain-stitch. The lines of this work do not in any way follow the meshes of the
    linen or canvas, as is mostly the case with book-work upon such material, but they
    curve freely according to the lines and folds of the design. It will be recognised I
    think by art workwomen skilled in this kind of small embroidery, that the methods
    used for ornamenting the canvas binding of this book are the most artistic of any of
    the various means employed for a similar purpose, and I know of no other instance
    which for appropriateness of workmanship, or charm of design, can compare with this,
    the earliest of all.</p>
    <p>The figure of the Virgin Mary, on the upper side, is dressed in a pale red robe,
    with an upper garment or cloak of blue with a gold border. On her head is a white
    head-dress, and round it a yellow halo; just above is a white dove flying downwards,
    its head having a small red nimbus or cloud round it. The Virgin holds a red book in
    her hand. The figure of the angel is winged, and wears an under robe of blue with an
    upper garment of yellow; round his head he has a green and yellow nimbus, his wings
    are crimson and white.</p>
    <span class="pagenum">31</span><a name="page_31" id="page_31"></a>
    <p>Between these two figures is a large yellow vase, banded with blue and red; out of
    it grows a tall lily, with a crown of three red blossoms.</p>
    <p>The drawing of both of the figures is good, the attitudes and the management of
    the folds of the drapery being excellently rendered, and the execution of the
    technical part is in no way inferior to the design.</p>
    <p>On the lower side, on a groundwork of gold similar to that on the upper cover, is
    a design of the Crucifixion. Our Saviour wears a red garment round the loins, and
    round his head is a red and yellow nimbus, his feet being crossed in a manner often
    seen in illuminations in ancient manuscripts.</p>
    <p>The cross is yellow with a green edge, the foot widening out into a triple arch,
    within which is a small angel kneeling in the attitude of prayer. On the right of the
    cross is a figure of the Virgin Mary, in robes of pale blue and yellow, with a white
    head-dress and green and yellow nimbus. On the left is another figure, probably
    representing St. John, dressed in robes of red and blue, and having a nimbus round
    his head of concentric rings of red and yellow. This figure is unfortunately in very
    bad condition. The edges of the leaves of the book are painted with heraldic bearings
    in diamond-shaped spaces, that of the Felbrigge family 'Gules, a lion rampant, or'
    alternately with another 'azure, a <span class="pagenum">32</span><a name="page_32"
    id="page_32"></a> fleur-de-lys, or.' The embroidered sides have been badly damaged by
    time and probably more so by repair. The book has been rebound in leather, the old
    embroidered back quite done away with, and the worked sides pulled away from their
    original boards and ruinously flattened out on the new ones. After the Felbrigge
    Psalter no other embroidered binding has been preserved till we come to one dating
    about 1536, which is in satin, and will be described under that head.</p>

    <p>The Princess Elizabeth, afterwards Queen, in her eleventh year, copied out in her
    own handwriting the <i>Miroir or Glasse of the Synneful Soul.</i> She says it is
    translated 'out of frenche ryme into english prose, joyning the sentences together as
    well as the capacitie of my symple witte and small lerning coulde extende
    themselves.' It is also most prettily dedicated: 'From Assherige, the last daye of
    the yeare of our Lord God 1544 ... To our most noble and vertuous Quene Katherin,
    Elizabeth her humble daughter wisheth perpetuall felicitie and everlasting joye.'</p>
    <p>The book is now one of the great treasures of the Bodleian Library; it is bound in
    canvas, measures about 7 by 5 inches, and was embroidered in all probability by the
    hands of the Princess <span class="pagenum">33</span><a name="page_33"
    id="page_33"></a>herself. The Countess of Wilton in her book on the art of needlework
    says that 'Elizabeth was an accomplished needlewoman,' and that 'in her time
    embroidery was much thought of.' The Rev. W. Dunn Macray in his <i>Annals of the
    Bodleian Library</i> considers this binding to be one of 'Elizabeth's bibliopegic
    achievements.'</p>
    <p>The design is the same upon both sides. The ground is all worked over in a large
    kind of tapestry-stitch in thick pale blue silk, very evenly and well done, so well
    that it has been considered more than once to be a piece of woven material. On this
    is a cleverly designed interlacing scroll-work of gold and silver braid, in the
    centre of which are the joined initials K. P.</p>
    <p>In each corner is a heartsease worked in thick coloured silks, purple and yellow,
    interwoven with fine gold threads, and a small green leaflet between each of the
    petals. The back is very much worn, but it probably had small flowers embroidered
    upon it.</p>

    <p>Another manuscript beautifully written by the Princess Elizabeth about a year
    later is now at the British Museum. It is on vellum, and contains prayers or
    meditations, composed originally by Queen Katherine Parr in English, and translated
    <span class="pagenum">34</span><a name="page_34" id="page_34"></a>by the Princess
    into Latin, French, and Italian. The title as given in the book reads, 'Precationes
    ... ex piis scriptoribus per nobiliss. et pientiss. D. Catharinam Anglie, Francie,
    Hibernieq. reginam collecte, et per D. Elizabetam ex anglico converse.' It is,
    moreover, dedicated to Henry <span class="smcap">viii.</span>, the wording being,
    'Illustrissimo Henrico octavo, Anglie, Francie, Hibernieq. regi,' etc., and dated
    Hertford, 20th December 1545.</p>
    <p>It is bound in canvas, and measures 5&frac34; by 4 inches, the groundwork being
    broadly worked in tapestry-stitch, or some stitch analogous to it, in red silk,
    resembling in method the work on the ground of <i>The Miroir of the Synneful Soul</i>
    already described. On this, in the centre of each side, is a large monogram worked in
    blue silk, interwoven with silver thread, containing the letters K, probably standing
    for Katherine, A, F, H, and R, possibly meaning 'Anglie, Francie, Hibernieque,
    Regin&aelig;,' but like most monograms this one can doubtless be otherwise
    interpreted. Above and below the monogram are smaller H's, worked in red silk,
    interwoven with gold thread. In each corner is a heartsease of yellow and purple
    silk, interwoven with gold thread, and having small green leaves between each of the
    petals. The work which was once on the back is now so worn that it cannot be traced
    sufficiently to tell what it originally was. The designs of these <span
    class="pagenum">35</span><a name="page_35" id="page_35"></a>two volumes, credited to
    the Princess Elizabeth, resemble each other to some extent; they both have a monogram
    in the centre, they both have heartsease in the corners and groundwork of a like
    character. They are, as far as workmanship goes, still more alike, similar thick silk
    is used for the ground, and threads and braids of a thick nature, with metal
    interwoven, are used on both for the ornamental work. Speaking of this British Museum
    book, the Countess of Wilton says, 'there is little doubt that Elizabeth's own needle
    wrought the ornaments thereon.'</p>
    <div class="subchap">
      <i>Books embroidered by the Princess Elizabeth.</i>
    </div>
    <p>It cannot be said that there is any actual authority for saying that the two
    covers just described are really the work of Elizabeth's own hand, although she is
    known to have been fond of embroidery, it being recorded that she made and
    embroidered a shirt for her brother Edward when she was six. There is little doubt,
    however, that the same designer and the same workwoman worked both these covers, and
    the technique, as well as the design, are peculiar for the time in which they were
    done. Canvas bindings were rare&mdash;most of the embroidered work on books of that
    period were splendid works on velvet&mdash;so that if these two manuscripts had been
    'given out' to be bound in embroidered covers we should have expected <span
    class="pagenum">36</span><a name="page_36" id="page_36"></a>to find them in rich
    velvet, like Brion's <i>Holy Land</i>, or Christopherson's <i>Historia
    Ecclesiastica</i>, instead of a very elementary braid work. Without attaching too
    much importance to the various statements concerning their royal origin, I am
    inclined to think that there is no impossibility, or even improbability, in the
    supposition that the Princess designed and worked them herself, thereby adding to her
    exquisite manuscript the further charm of her clever needle. The idea of both writing
    and embroidering such valued presents as these two books must have been is likely to
    have strongly appealed to an affectionate and humble daughter, and there is an
    artistic completeness in the idea which, I think, tells strongly in its favour.</p>
    <p>Probably enough no proof of their having been worked by Elizabeth will now ever be
    forthcoming, but it is equally unlikely that any positive disproof will be found.</p>
    <p>The two 'Elizabeth' books stand alone&mdash;there are no others resembling them;
    but the next kind of embroidered work I shall describe is one which includes a large
    number of books, generally small in size, and usually copies of the Bible or the
    Psalms. The canvas in these cases is embroidered all over in small tapestry-stitch,
    the design being shown by means of the different colours of the silks used. The work
    being all flat it is very strong, and often books bound in this way are <span
    class="pagenum">37</span><a name="page_37" id="page_37"></a>in a marvellous state of
    preservation. The most interesting designs are those which represent Scriptural
    scenes. Some of these are very curious and almost grotesque, but there is much excuse
    for this. To work a face any way in embroidery is troublesome enough, but to work it
    on a small scale in tent-stitch is especially difficult, the result being somewhat
    similar in effect to that of a glass or marble mosaic, each little stitch being
    nearly square and of an uniform colour. The designers of these embroideries do not
    appear to have had a very fertile imagination, as again and again the same subject is
    represented. Perhaps the most favourite of all is Jacob wrestling with the angel; of
    figure subjects 'Faith and Hope' are the most frequently met with, but 'Peace and
    Plenty' are also common enough.</p>

    leaves are indicated in the same way. There are remains of two green velvet ties on
    the front edges of each of the boards. The back is not divided into panels, but has a

    <p>During the seventeenth century little 'double' books were rather favourite forms
    for Common Prayer and Psalms especially. These curious bindings open opposite ways
    and have two backs, two ornamental boards, and one unornamented board enclosed
    between the two books, which are always of the same size.</p>
    <p>There are several instances where embroidered books have been bound in this way,
    the earliest I know being a copy of the Psalms and Common Prayer, printed in
    1606-7.</p>
    <p>This is bound in canvas, and measures 3&frac14; by 2 inches, each side having the
    same design embroidered on each of the ornamented sides and backs. The flowers and
    leaves are worked in long straight stitches in coloured silks, outlined with silver
    twist. A large pansy plant occupies the place of honour, growing out of a <span
    class="pagenum">39</span><a name="page_39" id="page_39"></a>small green mound, from
    which also spring two short plants with five-petalled yellow flowers. The main stems
    and ribs of the leaves are made with strong silver twist. Round about the central
    spray are several coloured buds. On the backs are four panels, each containing a
    small four-petalled flower. The ground is worked all over with silver thread
    irregularly stitched, and the edges are bound with a broad silver thread. There was
    originally one ribbon to twist round both books and keep them together, but it is now
    quite gone. The edges are gilt, gauffred, and slightly coloured.</p>

    <p>On the upper side is King Solomon seated in an elaborate throne on a dais, all
    outlined with gold cord. He wears a golden crown and a dress which more nearly
    approaches the style worn at the date of the production of the book than that which
    was probably worn by Solomon himself. Before the King kneels a figure, no doubt
    intended for the Queen of Sheba, in a red and orange robe of a curious fashion. She
    holds out <span class="pagenum">40</span><a name="page_40" id="page_40"></a>two white
    and red roses to the King, who bends to take them. The ground is patterned in green
    and blue diamonds. The distant landscape shows a castle with turrets, trees, a tower,
    a house, and a sun with rays. The groundwork on both sides and the back is worked in
    silver thread.</p>
    <p>The lower side has in the centre Jacob wrestling with the angel. Jacob has a beard
    and a blue cloak; his staff lies on the ground. The angel wears a red flowing robe,
    and his wings are many-coloured, and enriched with various threads and spirals of
    gold. The landscape is elaborate. In the foreground is a river with a bridge of
    planks, a gabled cottage, hospitably smoking from its chimneys, a red lily, and a
    tree. In the middle distance is a castle with tower and flag, and on the horizon are
    a windmill, a castle with two towers, and some trees, above all a red cloud. The back
    is divided into six panels, on each of which is a different design in coloured silks.
    These designs are small, and although they are in perfectly good condition, the
    subjects represented are doubtful. The upper and lower panels seem to represent only
    castles with towers. Then apparently come Jonah and the whale, the creation, the
    temple, and the deluge with the ark, but it is quite possible that other
    interpretations might be made. There are remains of two red silk ties on the front
    edges of each board, and the edges of the leaves are gilded simply.</p>

    <p>Mr. Yates Thompson has kindly allowed me to describe and illustrate an embroidered
    book belonging to him, bound in canvas, and measuring 5&frac34; by 4&frac14; inches.
    It is a collection of sermons preached by 'Samuel Ward, Bachelour of Divinity,' and
    printed in London, 1626-7, the binding being probably of about the latter date. On
    the upper cover is a lady in a blue dress, seated, and holding a hawk on her left
    wrist, and a branch with apples in her right. Round her are scattered flower sprays,
    honeysuckle, foxglove, a stalk with two large pears, a cluster of grapes, a twig with
    a butterfly upon it, and a wild-rose spray. The lady, the petals of the flowers, and
    the leaves are all worked in tapestry-stitch; the bird and the lady's hair in long
    straight stitches; the stalks, fruits, and grasses are worked in variously coloured
    silk threads, thickly and strongly bound round with very fine silver wire. The lady
    has a coif, cuff, and belt of short pieces of silver and gold guimp arranged like a
    plait.</p>
    <p>The under side shows a seated lady in a green dress, playing a lute left-handed.
    This most unusual position is probably not really intentional, but the drawing has
    accidentally been reversed. She is surrounded, like her companion with the hawk, by
    flower sprays, a thistle, cornflower, strawberries, a rose, lily, bluebell, and
    small<span class="pagenum">42</span><a name="page_42" id="page_42"></a> bunch of
    grapes, making a kind of arbour, with a wreath of red cloud at the top. The lady, the
    petals of the flowers, and the leaves are worked in fine tapestry-stitch; the stalks
    and fruits in coloured silks, mixed with silver wire. The lady has a coif and a cuff
    of silver guimp arranged in the same way as that on the other side.</p>
    <p>The back is divided into four panels by silver guimp, each containing a flower
    worked in tapestry-stitch, a blue flower, a wild rose, a pansy, and a thistle. The
    ground of the whole is loosely overcast with silver thread, the constructive lines of
    the book being marked by rows of silver guimp arranged in small arches. The edges are
    bound by a strong silver braid. The head and tail bands are worked in silver
    thread&mdash;an unusual method&mdash;and the edges are gilt and gauffred.</p>
    <p>There are two ties on each board of striped silk, much frayed and worn, but the
    embroidered work itself is in excellent condition, and very strong.</p>

    <p>On the upper cover is a full-length figure of Hope, with dark hair, dressed in a

    she holds an anchor. In the distant background is a cottage and a gibbet on a hill,
    the sun with rays just appearing under a cloud. On the hilly foreground is a red
    lily, and further afield a caterpillar and a strawberry plant. On the lower cover is
    a full-length figure of Faith, with fair hair, dressed in a blue dress with large
    falling collar, having a red flower at the point. In her left hand she holds an open
    book with the word '<span class="smcap">Faith</span>' written across it. On the hilly
    foreground is a large red tulip and a plant with red blooms, further afield are a
    pear-tree and two caterpillars.</p>
    <p>On the back are four panels, containing respectively a bird, a blue flower, a
    squirrel, and a red flower.</p>
    <p>On the front edge of the upper cover can be seen the remains of one tie of green
    silk, and the edges are protected all round by a piece of green silk braid. The edges
    of the leaves are plainly gilt.</p>
    <p>This cover is one of the rare instances of a book bound in embroidered work not
    made for it, the embroidery being clearly made for a book of about half the present
    thickness. It is possible that it was intended for either the New Testament or the
    Psalms separately, and, as an after-thought, was made to do double duty. But as it
    now is, the worked back is just a strip down the middle of the back itself, the
    designs of the sides encroaching considerably inwards.</p>

    <p>The background is all worked in with silver thread in chain-stitch. With this book
    is one of the now rare ornamental markers, which, no doubt, often went with
    embroidered books. It is fastened to an ornamental oblong cushion, probably made of

      <i>Metal Threads used on Embroidered Books.</i>
    </div>
    <p>Guimp and gold threads are largely used, as has already been noticed, in
    embroidered books from early times, but on the next specimen of a canvas-bound book I
    have chosen for description, dated 1642, a kind of metal thread occurs which is very
    curious. It is used at an earlier date on satin books, and it is also found more
    commonly upon them; but as I have put the canvas books first for the purpose of
    description, and the 'thread' occurs in one of them, this is the best place to put
    its description. This thread I call 'Purl,' and a thread with this name is mentioned
    in several places as having been used in England in the seventeenth century; but
    there is no description of it, so that this thread may not be the 'purl' mentioned by
    the seventeenth-century writers, but if it is not, I do not know what purl is,
    neither do I know any other special name for the thread. In order that there may be
    no doubt as to what I mean by purl, I will shortly describe the thread as I know
    it.</p>
    <p>First there is a very fine copper wire; this is <span class="pagenum">47</span><a
    name="page_47" id="page_47"></a>closely bound round with coloured silk, also very
    fine, and in this state it looks simply like a coloured thread. Then this coloured
    thread is itself closely coiled round something like a fine knitting-needle&mdash;in
    fact I have made it on one&mdash;and then pushed off in the form of a fine coiled
    tube. The thread is always cut into short lengths for use, and on books these short
    lengths are generally threaded and drawn together at their ends, making, so to speak,
    little arches&mdash;so that although on the under side of the material there is only
    a tiny thread, on the upper side there is a strong arch, practically of copper. On
    boxes and other ornamental productions of this same period, pieces of purl are not
    infrequently found laid flat like little bricks; and houses, castles, etc., are often
    represented by means of it; but on books the general use is either for flowers,
    grounds, or (in very small pieces) to keep on spangles. Obviously any coloured silk
    can be used in making this thread, so that it may be said that for coloured silk
    work, where strength is required, flowers worked in purl are the best. The colours
    used when roses are represented are usually graduated,&mdash;yellow or white in the
    centre, then gradually darkening outward, yellow, pale pink, and red, or pale yellow,
    pale blue, and dark blue. Purl flowers are usually accessories to some regular
    design, but, in one instance at least, to be described later on, it supplies the
    entire decoration of a small satin book.</p>

    <p>The design on a Bible with Psalms, printed in London in 1642, bound in fine
    canvas, and measuring 6 by 3&frac12; inches, is the same on both sides. The ground is
    all laid, or couched, with silver threads, caught down at intervals by small white
    stitches. In the centre is a circular silver boss, and out of this grow four lilies
    worked with silver thread in button-hole stitch; each of these lilies has a shape
    similar to its own underneath it, outlined with fine gold cord, and filled in with
    red silk; representing altogether white flowers with a red lining. These four red and
    white lilies make together the form of a Maltese cross, and between each of the arms
    is a purl rose with yellow centre and graduated blue petals. A double oval, with the
    upper and lower curves larger than the side ones, marked with a thick gold cord,
    encloses the central cross, and the remaining spaces are filled with ovals and lines
    of gold guimp, with here and there a little patch of red or yellow purl, the
    extremities of the upper and lower ovals being filled with threads of green silk
    loosely bound with a silver spiral, worked to represent a green plot.</p>
    <p>The upper and lower curves of the oval are thickened by an arch of gold thread
    laid lengthwise, and kept in place by little radiating lines of red silk. In each
    corner is a purl rose, with <span class="pagenum">49</span><a name="page_49"
    id="page_49"></a>blue centre, the petals graduating in colour from pale yellow to
    dark red, with leaf forms and stalks of gold cord and guimp. At the top and bottom of
    the oval is a many-coloured purl rose, and the spaces still left vacant are dotted
    with little pieces of red, blue, and yellow purl and spangles. On the front edges are
    the remains of two red silk ties.</p>
    <p>The back is divided into four panels by a thick gold twist. The upper and lower
    panels have each a blue purl rose worked in them, with a white and red lily in the
    same silver thread as those on the sides, with gold leaves and stalks; the two inner
    panels contain each three purl roses, with gold leaves and stems. The upper of these
    panels has a large rose of blue, yellow, and red, and two smaller ones yellow with
    blue centres; the lower panel has a large rose of red, pink, and yellow, and two
    smaller ones of red, with yellow centres.</p>
    <p>Dotted about the groundwork of the panels are several spangles and short lengths
    of coloured purl.</p>

    <p>A Bible, printed in London in 1648, formerly the property of George <span

    emblematic <span class="pagenum">50</span><a name="page_50"
    id="page_50"></a>representations of Faith and Hope. It measures 6&frac34; by
    4&frac34; inches.</p>
    <p>On the upper side is a full-length figure of Faith. She has fair hair, and is
    dressed in an orange and red dress cut low, and showing in the front a pale blue
    under garment. She has a large white collar and cuffs, both in point-lace, and bears
    in her right hand an open book with the word '<span class="smcap">Faith</span>'
    written upon it, while her left hand rests upon a pointed shield, pale purple with a
    yellow centre. She is standing upon a rounded hillock, on which are a strawberry
    plant with two fruits, two caterpillars, a red tulip, and another flower.</p>
    <p>In the right-hand upper corner is a turreted and gabled house, the windows of
    which are marked with little glittering pieces of talc. Below the house is a
    caterpillar and a large blue butterfly. In the left-hand upper corner is the sun, in
    gold, just appearing under a blue cloud. Underneath this, in succession, come a tree
    with a butterfly upon it, a bird, most likely meant for a wren, and another
    caterpillar. The remains of two red tie-ribbons are near the front edges. The
    background is worked in silver thread, and the edges of the boards are bound with
    silver braid having a thread or two of red silk on the innermost side.</p>
    <p>On the under cover Hope appears in a curiously worked upper garment of blue and
    white, <span class="pagenum">51</span><a name="page_51" id="page_51"></a>short in the
    sleeves, in needlepoint, with a belt. Under this is a dress of red and orange,
    showing a blue under skirt in front. A scarf of the same colour as the dress is
    gracefully folded over the shoulders and hangs over the left arm; a rather deep
    collar and cuffs are both worked in needlepoint. The right hand rests upon an anchor
    with a 'fouled' rope.</p>
    <p>Hope stands upon a rounded hillock, on which are a snail and spray of possible
    foxglove, and out of which grow a red carnation and another flower. In the upper
    right-hand corner is a gabled cottage with a tree, and under it a moth, flower, and
    caterpillar. Towards the upper left-hand corner is a bank of cloud with red and
    yellow rays issuing therefrom, and under it a pear-tree with flower and fruit, and a
    many-coloured butterfly. All the background is worked in silver thread.</p>
    <p>The five panels of the back, indicated with silver cord, are each filled with a
    different design. Beginning at the top, these are: a rose, a parrot with a red fruit,
    a double rose, a lion, and a lily. The edges are plainly gilt.</p>

    <p>t seems probable that velvet was a favourite covering for royal books in England
    from an early period. Such volumes as remain 'covered in vellat' that belonged to
    Henry <span class="smcap">vii</span>. are, however, not embroidered, the
    ornamentation upon them being worked metal, or enamels upon metal. It is not until
    the time of Henry <span class="smcap">viii</span>. that we have any instances
    remaining of books bound in embroidered velvet.</p>
    <p>Velvet is very troublesome to work upon, the pile preventing any delicate
    embroidery being done directly upon it, hence the prevalence of gold cords and
    appliqu&eacute; work on canvas or linen, on which of course the embroidery may be
    executed as delicately as may be desired.</p>

    <p>The earliest extant English binding in embroidered velvet covers this manuscript,
    which <span class="pagenum">53</span><a name="page_53" id="page_53"></a>belonged to
    Henry <span class="smcap">viii</span>., and is dedicated to him. The manuscript is on
    vellum, and is beautifully illuminated. It is bound in rich purple velvet, and each
    side, measuring 9 by 6 inches, is ornamented with the same design. In the centre is a
    large royal coat-of-arms, surrounded by the garter, and ensigned with a royal crown.
    The coat-of-arms and the garter are first worked in thick silks of the proper
    colours, red and blue, laid or couched, with small stitches of silk of the same
    colour, arranged so as to make a diamond pattern, on fine linen or canvas. On the
    coat are the arms of France and England quarterly; the bearings, respectively three
    fleur-de-lys and three lions, are solidly worked in gold cord, and the whole is
    appliqu&eacute; on to the velvet with strong stitches. On the blue garter the legend
    'Honi soit qui mal y pense' is outlined in gold cord, between each word being a small
    red rose, the buckle, end, and edge of the garter being marked also in gold cord, and
    the whole appliqu&eacute; like the coat. The very decorative royal crown is solidly
    worked in gold cords of varying thickness directly on to the velvet. The rim or
    circlet has five square jewels of red and blue silk along it, between each of these
    being two seed pearls. From the rim rise four crosses-pat&eacute;e and four
    fleurs-de-lys, at the base of each of which is a pearl, and also one in each inner
    corner of the crosses-pat&eacute;e. Four arches also rise from the<span
    class="pagenum">54</span><a name="page_54" id="page_54"></a> rim, the two outer ones
    each having three small scrolls with a pearl in the middle; at the top is a mound and
    cross-pat&eacute;e, with a pearl in each of its inner corners. There is a letter H on
    each side of the coat-of-arms, and these letters were originally doubtless worked
    with seed pearls, but the outlines of them alone are now left. In each corner is a
    red Lancastrian rose worked on a piece of satin, appliqu&eacute;, the centres and
    petals marked in gold cord, and the whole enclosed in an outer double border of gold
    cord. On the front edges of each side are the remains of two red silk ties.</p>
    <p>This is certainly a very handsome piece of work, and is wonderfully preserved. It
    is the earliest example of a really fine embroidered book on velvet in existence, and
    it has perhaps been more noticed and illustrated than any other book of its kind. The
    crown has an interesting peculiarity about it, which does not appear, as far as I
    have observed, on any other representation of it, namely, that the four arches take
    their rise directly from the rim. They generally rise from the summits of the
    crosses-pat&eacute;e, but I should fancy that the rise from the circlet itself is
    more correct.</p>

    <p>Another fine example of the decorative use of Heraldry occurs on a copy of
    Petrarch printed at Venice in 1544, and probably bound about 1548, after the death of
    Henry <span class="smcap">viii</span>. It belonged to Queen Katherine Parr, and bears
    her arms with several quarterings&mdash;worked appliqu&eacute; on rich blue purple
    velvet, and measures 7 by 6 inches. The first coat is the 'coat of augmentation'
    granted to the Queen by Henry <span class="smcap">viii</span>.&mdash;'Argent, on a
    pile gules, between six roses of the same, three others of the field'&mdash;and the
    next coat is that of 'Parr.'</p>
    <p>The various quarterings on this coat are worked differently from those on the last
    book described. Here the red and blue are well shown by pieces of coloured
    satin&mdash;except in the first, <span class="pagenum">56</span><a name="page_56"
    id="page_56"></a>fifth, and seventh coats, where there is some couched work in
    diamond pattern, just like that on Martin Brion's book. The entire coat, which is of
    an ornamental shape, is appliqu&eacute; in one large piece, and edged by a gold cord.
    The crown surmounting it is heavily worked in gold guimp&mdash;the cap being
    represented in crimson silk thread and all appliqu&eacute;. There are two
    supporters&mdash;that on the right, an animal breathing flame, and gorged with a
    coronet from which hangs a long chain, all worked in coloured silks on linen and
    appliqu&eacute;, belongs to the Fitzhugh family, the coat of which is shown on the
    third quarter; that on the left, a wyvern argent, also gorged with a coronet, from
    which depends a long gold chain, is that of the Parr family. The wyvern is a piece of
    blue silk, finished in gold and silver cords, in appliqu&eacute;. The gold cord
    enclosing the armorial design is amplified at each corner into an arabesque scroll.
    The book has been most unfortunately rebound, and the work is badly strained in
    consequence&mdash;the back being entirely new; nevertheless it is in a wonderful
    state of preservation. It is said to have been worked by Queen Katherine Parr
    herself. The design is too large for the book, and the crown is too large for the
    coat-of-arms. It is probable that the binding of the book was done after the death of
    Henry <span class="smcap">viii</span>., otherwise the supporters would have been the
    lion and the greyhound; also the<span class="pagenum">57</span><a name="page_57"
    id="page_57"></a> coat-of-arms would have been different; also, as the Seymour coat
    does not appear, it is likely that the binding was done before Queen Katherine Parr's
    marriage with Lord Seymour of Sudley, in 1547. The design is the same on both
    sides.</p>

    <p>Many fine bindings in embroidered velvet of the time of Queen Elizabeth still
    remain, several of them having been her own property.</p>
    <span class="pagenum">58</span><a name="page_58" id="page_58"></a>
    <p>One of the most decorative of these last is unfortunately in a very bad state,
    owing possibly to the fact that there were originally very many separate pearls upon
    it, and that these have from time to time been wilfully picked off. The book is in
    three volumes, and is a copy of the <i>Historia Ecclesiastica</i>, written by
    Christopherson, Bishop of Chichester, and printed at Louvain in 1569. Each of these
    volumes is bound in the same way, so the description of one of them will serve for
    all, except that no one volume is perfect, so the description must be taken as
    representing only what each originally was.</p>
    <p>It is covered in deep green velvet, and measures 6 by 3&frac12; inches, the design
    being the same on each side. In the centre the royal coat-of-arms is appliqu&eacute;
    in blue and red satin, on an ornamental cartouche of pink satin, with scrolls of gold
    threads and coloured silks, richly dotted with small pearls. The bearings on the
    coats-of-arms are solidly worked in fine gold threads.</p>
    <p>From each corner of the sides springs a rose spray, with Tudor roses of red silk
    mixed with pearls, and Yorkist roses all worked in pearls clustering tight together,
    the leaves and stems being made in gold cord and guimp. A decoratively arranged
    ribbon outlined with gold cord and filled in with a line of small pearls set near
    each other, encloses the design, and numerous <span class="pagenum">59</span><a
    name="page_59" id="page_59"></a>single pearls are set in the spaces between the roses
    and their leaves and stems.</p>
    <p>The back is divided into five panels bearing alternately Yorkist roses of pearls
    and Tudor roses of red silk and pearls, all worked in the same way as the roses on
    the sides.</p>
    <p>The illustration I give of this binding (<a
    href="#plate_19"><i>Frontispiece</i></a>) is necessarily a restoration. But there is
    nothing added which was not originally on the book. Each pearl that has disappeared
    has left a little impress on the velvet, and so has each piece of gold cord which has
    been pulled off. The back is still existing; but bad though both sides and back now
    are, it is much better they should be in their present condition than that they
    should have been mended or replaced in parts by newer material.</p>

    large spangles, and the leaves, worked in gold, have a few strands of green silk in
    them; large spangles, kept down by a short piece of guimp, are used to fill in spaces

      London, 1572.</p>
    </div>
    <p>This is one of the embroidered books that belonged to Queen Elizabeth, and has
    been frequently illustrated and described. It is remarkable in other respects than
    for its binding, as it is one of a number of probably not more than twenty copies of
    a work by Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury, <i>De antiquitate Ecclesi&aelig;
    Britannic&aelig;</i>, printed for him by John Day in London, 1572. It was the first
    instance of a privately printed book being issued in England.</p>
    <p>Archbishop Parker had a private press, and <span class="pagenum">61</span><a
    name="page_61" id="page_61"></a>his books were printed with types cast at his own
    cost, John Day being sometimes employed as his workman. No two copies of this
    particular work are alike, and it is supposed that the Archbishop continually altered
    the sheets as they came from the press and had the changes effected at once. The book
    has two title-pages, each of which, as well as a leaf containing the arms of the
    Bishops in vellum, the ornamental borders, and coats-of-arms throughout the book, are
    emblazoned in gold and colours.</p>
    <p>The biographies of sixty-nine Archbishops are contained in the book, but not
    Parker's own. This omission was supplied afterwards by a little satirical tract
    published in 1574, entitled 'Histriola, a little storye of the actes and life of
    Matthew, now archbishop of Canterbury.'</p>
    <p>But the Archbishop not only had his printing done under his own roof, but also had
    in his house 'Paynters ... wryters, and Boke-binders,' so that it may fairly enough
    be considered that he bound the splendid copy of his great work which was intended
    for the Queen's acceptance, in a specially handsome manner, under his own direct
    supervision, and in accordance not only with his own taste but also with that of his
    royal mistress. The volume is a large one, measuring 10 by 7 inches, and is covered
    in dark green velvet. On both sides the design is a rebus <span
    class="pagenum">62</span><a name="page_62" id="page_62"></a>on the name of Parker,
    representing in fact a Park within a high paling. The palings are represented as if
    lying flat, and are worked in gold cord with flat strips of silver, on yellow satin
    appliqu&eacute;. There are gates and other small openings in the continuity of the
    line of palings. On the upper cover within the paling is a large rose-bush, bearing a
    large Tudor rose and two white roses in full bloom, with buds and leaves, some
    tendrils extending over the palings. The stalks are of silver twist edged with gold
    cord, the red flowers are worked with red silk and gold cord, the white ones made up
    with small strips of flat silver and gold cord. Detached flowers and tufts of grass
    grow about the rose-tree; among these are two purple and yellow pansies, Elizabeth's
    favourite flowers, and in each corner is a deer, one 'courant,' one 'passant,' one
    feeding, and one 'lodged.'</p>
    <p>The design fills the side of the book very fully, and the workmanship is
    everywhere excellent. This upper cover is much faded, as it has been for many years
    exposed to the light in one of the Binding show-cases in the King's Library at the
    British Museum.</p>
    <p>The under side is much fresher, but the design not so elaborate. There is a
    similar paling to that on the other side, the 'Park' being dotted about with several
    plants, ferns, and tufts of grass. Near each corner is a deer, one feeding, <span
    class="pagenum">63</span><a name="page_63" id="page_63"></a>one 'couchant,' one
    'tripping,' and one 'courant,' and one 'lodged' in the centre. There are also two
    snakes worked in silver thread with small colour patches in silk.</p>
    <p>The back is badly worn, but the original design can be easily traced upon it.
    There were five panels, in each of which is a small rose-tree, bearing one large
    flower, with leaves and buds, and tufts of grass. The first, third, and fifth of
    these are white Yorkist roses; the second and third are Tudor roses of white and
    red.</p>

    <p>If this book of Archbishop Parker's is one of the most elaborately ornamented
    embroidered books existing, and perhaps one of the greatest treasures of its kind in
    the British Museum, the next velvet book to describe is one of the simplest, yet it
    also is one of the greatest treasures of its kind at the Bodleian Library.</p>
    <p>It is a small copy of the Epistles of St. Paul, printed by Barker in London, 1578,
    and measuring 4&frac12; by 3&frac12; inches, and it belonged to Queen Elizabeth.
    Inside she has written a note in which she says: 'I walke manie times into the
    pleasant fieldes of the Holy Scriptures, where I plucke up the goodlie greene herbes
    of sentences by pruning, eate them by reading, chawe them by musing, and laie them up
    at length in the hie seat of <span class="pagenum">64</span><a name="page_64"
    id="page_64"></a>memorie by gathering them together, so that having tasted thy
    swetenes I may the less perceive the bitterness of this miserable life.'</p>
    <p>The Rev. W. D. Macray, in the <i>Annals of the Bodleian Library</i>, says, 'This
    belonged to Queen Elizabeth, and is bound in a covering worked by herself'; and the
    Countess of Wilton, in the <i>Art of Embroidery</i>, says, 'The covering is done in
    needlework by the Queen herself.'</p>
    <p>It is also described by Dibdin in <i>Bibliomania.</i> He says, 'The covering is
    done in needlework by the Queen herself.'</p>
    <p>The black velvet binding is much worn, and has been badly repaired. The work upon
    it is all done in silver cord or guimp, and the designing, as well as the work, is
    such as may well have been done by the Queen.</p>
    <p>On both covers borders with legends in Latin, enclosed in lines of gold cord, run
    parallel to the edges. Beginning at the right-hand corners of each side, these
    legends read, 'Beatus qui divitias scriptur&aelig; legens verba vertit in
    opera&mdash;Celum Patria Scopus vit&aelig; <span
    class="smcap">xpus</span>&mdash;Christus via&mdash;Christo vive.' In the centre of
    the upper side is a ribbon outlined in gold cord, with the words, 'Eleva sursum ibi
    ubi,' a heart being enclosed within the ribbon, and a long stem with a flower at the
    top passing through it. In the centre of the lower side a similar ribbon with the
    motto, 'Vicit omnia pertinax virtus,' encloses a daisy, a badge previously <span
    class="pagenum">65</span><a name="page_65" id="page_65"></a>used by Henry <span
    class="smcap">viii</span>. and Edward <span class="smcap">vi</span>., probably in
    memory of their ancestress, Margaret Beaufort. Both these inner scrolls have the
    initial letter E interwoven with them.</p>
    <p>There is no doubt that the usual royal embroidered bindings of the time of
    Elizabeth were elaborately designed and richly worked, in decided contrast to this
    small book; and this difference of style makes it more probable that the Queen worked
    it herself.</p>
    <p>There is no resemblance between this book and the two canvas-bound books already
    described which are attributed to her, except the use of cord alone in the
    embroidery; but the difference of material might perhaps be considered sufficient to
    account for this. No real evidence seems to be forthcoming as to the authorship of
    the embroidered work, but there is no doubt that the book was a favourite one of
    Queen Elizabeth's, and if the needlework had been done for her by any of the ladies
    of her Court, it would be likely that she would have added a note to that effect to
    the words she has written inside.</p>

    <p>A copy of <i>Christian Prayers</i>, with the Psalms, printed in London in 1581 and
    1584, is curiously bound in soft paper boards strengthened on the inner side with
    pieces of morocco and covered <span class="pagenum">66</span><a name="page_66"
    id="page_66"></a>with pale tawny velvet. It measures 7&frac12; by 5&frac12; inches.
    The edges of the leaves are gilt and gauffred.</p>
    <p>The arrangement of the design is unusual. It starts from the centre of the back in
    the form of a broad ornamental border, extending towards the front edges along the
    lines of the boards. This border is handsomely ornamented by a wavy line of silver
    cords, filled out with conventional flowers and arabesques worked in gold and silver
    cords and threads, with a little bit of coloured silk here and there. A symmetrical
    design of flower forms and arabesques starts, on each board, from the centre of the
    inner edge of the border, and is worked in a similar way. Some of the leaves,
    however, have veinings marked by strips of flat silver, and others made by a
    flattened silver spiral, having the appearance of a succession of small rings. There
    are the remains of two pale orange silk ties on the front edges of each board, and
    the edges are gilt and gauffred with a little colour.</p>
    <p>The petals of the flowers are worked in guimp, whether gold or silver is difficult
    to say. Indeed in many instances of the older books it is difficult to be sure
    whether a metal cord or thread was originally gilded or not, as all these 'gold'
    threads are, or were, silver gilt, so that when worn the silver only remains. If the
    cord or thread has been protected in any corners, however, or if it <span
    class="pagenum">67</span><a name="page_67" id="page_67">can be lifted a little, the
    faint trace of gold can often be seen on what would otherwise have been surely put
    down as originally silver.</a></p>

    leaves worked in gold cord and silver guimp with a trifle of coloured silk on the red
    roses and on the small leaves showing between the petals. On the front edge are the
    remains of red and gold ties. The design of this charming little book is excellent,
    and the colour of it when new must have been very effective. The design is the same

    id="page_68">the time of Elizabeth is now at the Bodleian Library at
    Oxford. It is one of the 'Douce' Bibles, printed in London in 1583, and probably
    bound about the same time. It was the property of the Queen herself, and is bound in
    crimson velvet, measuring 17 by 12 inches. The design is the same on both sides, and
    consists of a very cleverly arranged scroll of six rose stems, bearing flowers, buds,
    and leaves springing from a large central rose, with four auxiliary scrolls crossing
    the corners and intertwining at their ends. The large rose in the centre as well as
    those near the corners are Tudor roses, the red shown in red silk and the white in
    silver guimp, both outlined with gold cord. Small green leaves are shown between each
    of the outer petals. These flowers are heavily and solidly worked in high relief. The
    smaller flowers are all of silver, the buds, some red, some white. The stems are of
    thick silver twist enclosed between finer gold cords, and the leaves show a little
    green silk among the gold cord with which they are outlined and veined. Immediately
    above and below the centre rose are two little T's worked in small pearls.</a></p>
    <p>The narrow border round the edges is very pretty; it is a wavy line of gold cord
    and green silk, the hollows within the curves being filled with alternate 'Pods' with
    pearls, and green leaves. The back is divided into four panels by wavy lines of gold
    cord and pearls, and the upper<span class="pagenum">69</span><a name="page_69"
    id="page_69"></a> and lower panels have small rose-plants with white roses, buds, and
    leaves; the inner panels have each a large Tudor rose of red and white, with leaves
    and buds. The drawing and designing of this splendid book are admirable, and the
    workmanship is in every way excellent. Many of the pearls are gone, and some of the
    higher portions of the large roses are abraded, the back, as usual, being in a rather
    bad state; but in spite of all this, and the inevitable fading, the work remains in a
    sufficiently preserved condition to show that at this period the art of
    book-embroidery reached its highest decorative point. It is rather curious to note
    that Henry <span class="smcap">viii</span>. used the red Lancastrian rose by
    preference, but that on Elizabeth's books the white rose always appears, and I know
    of very few instances where the red rose appears on her books. Of course both
    sovereigns used the combined, double, or Tudor rose as well.</p>

    upon it is a broad outer border doubly outlined with a curious and effective braid,
    apparently consisting of a close series of small silver rings, but really being only
    a silver spiral flattened out. This border is dotted at regular intervals with
    star-shaped clusters of small pieces of silver guimp symmetrically arranged. The
    centre of the inner panel is a diamond-shaped ornament made with similar 'ring' braid
    and small pieces of silver guimp, and the corner-pieces are quarter circles worked in
    the same way. This design of centre-piece and corner-pieces is distinctly borrowed
    from leather work, and I have never seen another example of the kind executed in
    needlework. The colouring of this book is very good, the purple and silver
    harmonising in a very pleasing manner.</p>

    conventional arrangement of curving stems and flower forms worked in gold cord,
    guimp, and small pearls thickly encrusted; the same on both boards. The centre is a
    large conventional <span class="pagenum">71</span><a name="page_71"

    a garnet below it, and flanked by the letters T. G., all thickly worked with reed
    pearls. In each corner is a smaller flower&mdash;conventionalised forms probably of
    honeysuckle and rose&mdash;joined together by curving stems of gold cord, filled out
    with leaves and arabesques, all together forming a very decorative panel. The outer
    border is richly worked with leaves and arabesques in guimp and pearls, the outer
    line of gold cord being ornamented with small triple points marked with pearls. The
    back is divided into three spaces by curving lines of gold cord, and in each of these
    spaces is worked one of the same conventionalised flower forms as occur on the

    curves of gold cord.</p>
    <p>The ground of the entire work is freely ornamented with gilt spangles held down by
    small pieces of guimp, and with single pearls; the larger of these are enclosed

    corner with stalks and leaves. The coat-of-arms is made up with pieces of blue and
    red satin, the bearings heavily worked with gold thread, and the ground also thickly
    studded with small straight pieces of guimp, doubtless put there to insure the
    greater flatness of the satin. The crown with which the coat-of-arms is ensigned is
    all worked in guimp, and is without the usual cap. The ornaments on the rim are only

    <p>To Henry, Prince of Wales, we owe a great debt of gratitude, as he was the first
    person of <span class="pagenum">73</span><a name="page_73" id="page_73"></a> much
    consequence in our royal family to take any real interest in the Old Royal
    Library.</p>
    <p>Indeed it may be considered that the existence to-day of the splendid 'Old Royal'
    Library of the kings of England, which was presented to the nation in 1759 by George
    <span class="smcap">ii</span>., is largely due to the attention drawn to its interest
    and value by Prince Henry, who moreover added considerably to it himself.</p>
    <p>This Prince used as his favourite and personal badge the beautiful design of three
    white ostrich feathers within a golden coronet, and with the motto '<span
    class="smcap">ich dien</span>' on a blue ribbon. With regard to the origin of this
    badge there is unfortunately a good deal of obscurity. The usual explanation is that
    it was the helmet-crest of the blind king of Bohemia, who was killed at Cr&eacute;cy
    in 1346, and that in remembrance of this it was adopted by the Black Prince as his
    badge. But, as a matter of fact, the ostrich feather was used as a family badge by
    all the sons of Edward <span class="smcap">iii</span>. and their descendants. It
    appears to have been the cognisance of the province of Ostrevant, a district lying
    between Artois and Hainault, and the appanage of the eldest sons of the house of
    Hainault. In this way it may have been adopted by the family of Edward <span
    class="smcap">iii</span>. by right of his wife, Philippa of Hainault.</p>
    <p>An early notice of the ostrich feather as a royal badge occurs in a note in one of
    the Harleian <span class="pagenum">74</span><a name="page_74" id="page_74"></a><span
    class="smcap">mss</span>. to the effect that 'Henrye, son to the erle of Derby, fyrst
    duke of Lancaster, gave the red rose crowned, whose ancestors gave the fox tayle in
    his proper cooler, and the ostrych fether, the pen ermine,' the Henry here mentioned
    being the father of Blanche, wife of John of Gaunt.</p>
    <p>On the tomb of Prince Arthur, son of Henry <span class="smcap">vii</span>., at
    Worcester, the feather is shown both singly and in plume, and it occurs in the triple
    plume form within a coronet and a scroll with the words '<span class="smcap">ich
    dien</span>' upon it, on bindings made by Thomas Berthelet for Prince Edward, son of
    Henry <span class="smcap">viii</span>., who never was Prince of Wales.</p>
    <p>It really seems as if the first 'Prince of Wales' actually to use the ostrich
    feather plumes as a personal badge of that dignity was Prince Henry, and it occurs
    largely on such books belonging to his library as he had rebound, and also on books
    that were specially bound for presentation to him.</p>
    <p>This is the case in one of the most decorative bindings he possessed, enclosing a
    collection of tracts originally the property of Henry <span
    class="smcap">viii</span>., but which somehow or other became the property of
    Magdalen College, Cambridge, the governing body of which had it bound in embroidered
    velvet and presented to Prince Henry.</p>
    <p>The cover is of crimson velvet, the edges of which extend freely beyond the edges
    of the book, bound all round with a fringe of gold cord. It<span
    class="pagenum">75</span><a name="page_75" id="page_75"></a> measures about 8 by 6
    inches. The design is the same on each side. In the centre is a large triple plume of
    ostrich feathers, thickly and beautifully worked in small pearls, within a golden
    coronet, and having below them the motto '<span class="smcap">ich dien</span>' in
    gold upon a blue silk ribbon.</p>
    <p>The badge is enclosed in a rectangular panel of gold cords, in each corner of
    which is an ornamental spray of gold cords, guimp, and a flower in pearls. A broad
    border with a richly designed arabesque of gold guimp or cord, with pearl flowers,
    encloses the central panel. The design is filled in freely with small pearls enclosed
    in guimp circles and small pearls alone.</p>
    <p>The back has an ornamental design in gold cord and guimp. This cover is a
    beautiful specimen of later decorative work on velvet, and the general effect is
    extremely rich, the design and workmanship being equally well chosen as regards the
    materials to which they are applied, and with which they are worked.</p>

    <p>A copy of another work by the same author, the Essays printed in 1625, was given
    by him to the Duke of Buckingham, and is now at the Bodleian Library at Oxford. It is
    bound in dark green velvet, measuring about 7 by 5 inches, the same design being
    embroidered on each side. In the centre is a small panel portrait of the Duke of
    Buckingham, with short beard, and wearing the ribbon of the Garter. The portrait is
    mostly worked with straight perpendicular stitches, except the hair and collar, in
    which the stitches are differently arranged. The background merges from nearly white
    just round the head to pink at the outer edge; the coat is brownish. The framework
    of the portrait is solidly worked in gold braids and silver guimp in relief, the
    design being of an architectural character. Two columns, with floral capitals and
    pediments, spring from a scroll-work base and support what may perhaps be intended
    for a gothic arch with crockets. Immediately above the crown of the arch is a ducal
    coronet, and a handsome border of elaborate<span class="pagenum">77</span><a

    the edges. The outlines of these arabesques, the stalks and curves, are all worked in
    gold cords, the petals and leaves in silver guimp in relief. The back is divided into
    eight panels by gold and silver cords, and in each of these panels is a four-petalled
    flower with small circles. There are several gilt spangles kept down by a small piece
    of guimp.</p>

    <p>Among the few older royal books in the library at Windsor Castle is an embroidered
    one that belonged to Prince Charles, afterwards Charles <span

    London in 1638, and is bound in blue velvet with embroidered work in gold cord and
    silver guimp, similar in character to that on the copy of Bacon's <i>Essays</i> just
    described. It measures 8 by 6 inches. The design is heraldic. In the centre is the
    triple plume of the Prince of Wales, with coronet and label, no motto being apparent
    on the latter. The plume is encircled by the Garter appliqu&eacute;, on pale blue
    silk, the motto, worked in silver cord, being nearly worn off. Resting on the top of
    the Garter is a large princely coronet, flanking which are the letters 'C. P.' In the
    lower corners are a thistle and a rose. A broad border with arabesques encloses <span
    class="pagenum">78</span><a name="page_78" id="page_78"></a>the central panel. This
    book was exhibited by Her Majesty at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1891. It is in
    very bad condition, which is curious, as it is not so very old, and as it is still
    among the royal possessions it might well have been imagined that it would have been
    better preserved than other and older books of a like kind which we know have been
    considerably moved about. The colour is however very charming still, and books have
    rarely been bound in blue velvet, black, green, or crimson being most usual.</p>
    <p>After 1649, or thereabouts, there was a full stop for a time to any art production
    in the matter of bookbinding. Indeed, for the embroidered books as a class that is
    the end, but nevertheless a few examples are found at a later date, but no regular
    production and no original designs.</p>

    <p>A large Bible printed at Cambridge in 1674, in two volumes, was bound in crimson
    velvet for James <span class="smcap">ii</span>., presumably about 1685. The work upon
    it, each volume being the same, is of a showy character, good and strong, but utterly
    wanting in any of the artistic qualities either of design or execution which
    characterised so many of the earlier examples. In the centre are the initials 'J. R.'
    surmounted by a royal crown, heavily <span class="pagenum">79</span><a name="page_79"
    id="page_79"></a>worked in gold braid, guimp, and some coloured silks. Enclosing the
    initials and crown are scrolls in thick gold twist; these again are surrounded by a
    curving ribbon of gold, intertwined with roses and leafy sprays. In each corner is a
    silver-faced cherub with beads for eyes and gold wings, and at the top a small blue
    cloud with sun rays, tears dropping from it. There are two broad silk ties to the
    front of each board, heavily fringed with gold.</p>
    <p>The back is divided into nine panels, each containing an arabesque ornament worked
    in gold cord and thread, the first and last panels being larger than the others and
    containing a more elaborate design. The edges of the leaves are simply gilt, and the
    boards measure 18 by 12 inches each, the largest size of any embroidered book known

    <p>erhaps the earliest existing English book bound in satin is a collection of
    sixteenth-century tracts that belonged to Henry <span class="smcap">viii</span>., and
    is now part of the Old Royal Library in the British Museum. It is covered in red
    satin, measures 12 by 8 inches, and is embroidered in an arabesque design, outlined
    with gold cord. On the edges the words 'Rex in aeternum vive Neez' are written in
    gold. The word 'Neez' or 'Nez,' as it is sometimes spelt, may mean Nebuchadnezzar, as
    the other words were addressed to him. On books bound in leather by Thomas Berthelet,
    royal binder to Henry <span class="smcap">viii</span>. and his immediate successors,
    the motto often occurs, and as he is known to have bound books in 'crymosyn satin,'
    this is most likely his work. The pattern <span class="pagenum">81</span><a
    name="page_81" id="page_81"></a>is worked irregularly all round the boards, and a
    sort of arabesque bridge crosses the centres. The back is new, and of leather, but
    the boards themselves are the original ones, and the embroidery is in a very fair
    condition.</p>

    <p>If early bindings in satin are rare, still rarer is the use of silk. One example
    worked on white ribbed silk still remains that belonged to Queen Elizabeth. It
    measures 4&frac34; by 2&frac34; inches, and in its time was no doubt a very
    decorative and interesting piece of work, but it is now in a very dilapidated state,
    largely due to improper repairing. The book has actually been rebound in leather, and
    the old embroidered sides stuck on. So it must be remembered that my illustration of
    it is considerably restored. The design, alike on both sides, is all outlined with
    gold cords and twists of different kinds and thicknesses, and the colour is added in
    water-colours on the silk. In the centre is the royal coat-of-arms within an oval
    garter ensigned with a royal crown, in the adornment of which a few seed pearls are
    used, as they are also on the ends of the garter.</p>
    <p>Enclosing the coat-of-arms is an ornamental border of straight lines and curves,
    worked with a thick gold twist, intertwined with graceful sprays of double and single
    roses, outlined in <span class="pagenum">82</span><a name="page_82"
    id="page_82"></a>gold and coloured red, with buds and leaves. A few symmetrical
    arabesques, similarly outlined and coloured, fill in some of the remaining spaces.
    The work on this book, a <i>New Testament in Greek</i>, printed at Leyden in 1576, is
    like no other; but the general idea of the design, rose-sprays cleverly intertwined,
    is one that may be considered characteristic of the Elizabethan embroidered books, as
    it frequently occurs on them. The use of water-colour with embroidery is very rare,
    and it is never found on any but silk or satin bindings, generally as an adjunct in
    support of coloured-silk work over it, but in this single instance it is used
    alone.</p>
    <div class="subchap">
      <i>Seventeenth-Century Embroidered Books.</i>
    </div>
    <p>The books described hitherto have been specimens of rare early instances, but in
    the seventeenth century there is a very large field to choose from. Small books,
    mostly religious works, were bound in satin from the beginning of the century until
    the time of the Commonwealth in considerable numbers; so much so, in fact, that their
    value depends not so much upon their designs or workmanship as upon their
    condition.</p>
    <p>It is generally considered that embroidered books are extremely delicate, but this
    is not so; they will stand far more wear than would<span class="pagenum">83</span><a
    name="page_83" id="page_83"></a> be imagined from their frail appearance. The
    embroidered work actually protects the satin, and such signs of wear as are visible
    are often found rather in the satin itself, where unprotected, than in the work upon
    it. In many cases a peculiar appearance, which is often mistaken for wear, is seen in
    the case of representations of insects, caterpillars, or butterflies particularly.
    These creatures, or parts of them, appear to consist only of slight stitches of plain
    thread, suggesting either that the work has never been finished, or else that the
    finished portions have worn away. The real fact is, however, that these places have
    been originally worked with small bright pieces of peacock's feather, which have
    either tumbled out or been eaten away by minute insects, a fate to which it is well
    known peacocks' feathers are particularly liable.</p>
    <p>The late Lady Charlotte Schreiber, who was a great collector of pieces of old
    embroidery, among a host of other curious things possessed the only perfect instance
    of work of this kind of the seventeenth century I have ever been fortunate enough to
    find. It was a very realistic caterpillar, closely and completely worked with very
    small pieces of peacocks' feathers, sewn on with small stitches, quite confirming the
    opinion I had already formed as to the original filling in of the usual 'bald' spaces
    representing such objects.</p>

    <p>A copy of a Bible, printed in London in 1619, is bound in white satin, and
    measures 6 by 3&frac12; inches. On each side is an emblematic figure enclosed in an
    oval; the figures are different, but their surroundings are alike. On the upper side
    a lady holding a palm branch in her right hand is worked in shading-stitch. She is
    full length, and wears an orange skirt with purple robe over it confined by a blue
    belt, and over her shoulders a pink jacket&mdash;all these garments are outlined by a
    gold cord. Her fair hair is covered by an ornamental cap of red and gold, and her
    feet are bare.</p>
    <p>The ground is worked with coloured silks and threads of fine wire closely twisted
    round with coloured silks, and the sky, painted in gradations of pink in
    water-colours, is worked sparsely with long stitches of blue silk.</p>
    <p>The lower side shows a female figure worked in a similar way; in this case she
    bears in her right hand some kind of wand or spray, which has nearly worn off, and in
    her left a bunch of corn or grapes, or something of that kind which has also badly
    worn away. If the first figure may be considered to represent Peace, this one may
    perhaps be Plenty. She wears a deep purplish skirt, with full over-garment and body
    of the same colour, with an under-jacket of white and gold. On her <span
    class="pagenum">85</span><a name="page_85" id="page_85"></a>dark hair she has a blue
    flower with red leaves. Her feet are bare. The ground and sky are both worked in the
    same way as the other side. Both figures are enclosed in a flat oval border of gold
    thread, broad at the top and narrowing towards the foot. In the corners are
    symmetrical arabesques thickly worked in gold, and within the larger spaces in each
    corner-piece are the 'remains' of feathered caterpillars, now skeleton forms of
    threads only. The back of the book is particularly good, and most beautifully worked.
    It is divided into five panels, within each of which is a conventional flower, a
    cornflower alternating with a carnation, and the colours of all of these are
    marvellously fresh and effective. Among embroidered panelled backs it is probably the
    finest specimen existing.</p>

    <p>One of the most curious embroidered satin bindings still left is now in the
    Bodleian Library, and a slightly absurd tradition about it says that the figure of
    David, which certainly is something like Charles <span class="smcap">i</span>., is
    clothed in a piece of a waistcoat that belonged to that king.</p>
    <p>It is a New Testament, printed in London in 1625, and covered in white satin, with
    a different design embroidered on each side. It measures 4&frac12; by 3&frac12;
    inches. On the upper board is David with a harp. He wears a long red cloak lined with
    <span class="pagenum">87</span><a name="page_87" id="page_87"></a>ermine, with a
    white collar, an under-garment of pale brown, and high boots with spur-straps and red
    tops. On his head is a royal crown of gold with red cap, and he is playing upon a
    golden harp. The face of this figure resembles that of Charles <span
    class="smcap">i</span>. The red cloak is worked in needlepoint lace, and is in deep
    folds in high relief. These folds are actually modelled in waxed paper, the
    needlework being stretched over them, and probably fixed on by a gentle heat. The
    other parts of the dress are worked in the same way, but without the waxed paper, and
    the edges of the garments are in some places marked with what might be called a metal
    fringe, made in a small recurring pattern.</p>
    <p>David is standing upon a grass plot, represented by small arches of green purl,
    and before him is sitting a small dog with a blue collar. Above the dog is a small
    yellow and black pansy, then a large blue 'lace' butterfly, on a chenille patch, and
    a brown flying bird. Behind David there is a tall conventional lily and a flying
    bird. The sky is overcast with heavy clouds of red and blue, but a golden sun with
    tinsel rays is showing under the larger of them. On the lower board is a
    representation of Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac. Abraham is dressed in a red
    under-garment on waxed paper, in heavy folds with a belt and edge of stamped-out
    metal, a blue flowing cape<span class="pagenum">88</span><a name="page_88"
    id="page_88"></a> and high boots, all worked in needlepoint lace in coloured
    silks.</p>
    <p>In his right hand he holds a sword, and his tall black hat is on the ground beside
    him. On the ground towards the left is Isaac in an attitude of prayer, his hands
    crossed, with two sheaves of firewood. He wears a red coat with a small blue cape.
    The ground is green and brown chenille. Above Isaac is a gourd, and above this a
    silver ram caught in a bush, on a patch of grass indicated by green purl. The sky is
    occupied by a large cloud, out of which leans an angel with wings, the hands
    outstretched and restraining Abraham's sword.</p>
    <p>On the back are four panels, containing respectively from the top a butterfly, a
    rose, a bird, and a yellow tulip, all worked in needlepoint and appliqu&eacute;. The
    pieces that are in high relief all over the book are edged with gold twist, and have
    moreover their counterparts under them closely fastened down to the satin. There are
    several gold spangles in the various spaces between the designs; the whole is edged
    with a strong silver braid, and there are two clasps with silver attachments.</p>
    <p>Considering the high relief in which much of this work is done, the binding is in
    wonderful preservation, but many of the colours are badly faded, as it has been
    exposed to the action of light in one of the show-cases for many years. <span
    class="pagenum">89</span><a name="page_89" id="page_89"></a>Although no doubt it is
    advisable to expose many treasures in this way, it must be admitted that in the case
    of embroidered books it is frequently, if not always, a cause of rapid deterioration,
    so much so that I should almost think in these days of good chromo-printing it would
    be worth the while of the ruling powers of our great museums to consider whether it
    would not be wiser to exhibit good colour prints to the light and keep the precious
    originals in safe obscurity, to be brought out, of course, if required by
    students.</p>

    <p>Several small English books of the seventeenth century were bound 'double,'
    <i>i.e.</i> two volumes side by side, so as to open different ways (compare p. 38).
    Each of the books, which are always of the same size, has a back and one board to
    itself, the other board, between them, being common to both. As already stated, this
    form of book occurs rarely in canvas bindings, and it is of commoner occurrence in

    <p>A design which is frequently met with is well shown in the case of a double
    specimen containing the New Testament and the Psalms, printed in London in 1630, and
    covered in white satin, measuring 4&frac14; by 2 inches, the ornamentation being the
    same on both sides. In the centre, in <span class="pagenum">90</span><a
    name="page_90" id="page_90"></a>an oval, is a delicately worked iris of many colours
    in feather-stitch, the petals edged with fine silver cord. The oval is marked by a
    silver cord, beyond which are ornamental arabesques outlined in cord and filled in
    solidly, in high relief, with silver thread.</p>
    <p>The backs are divided into five panels, containing alternately flowers in red,
    blue, and green silks, and star shapes in silver thread in high relief. Silver
    spangles have been freely used, but most of them have now gone; the edges of the
    leaves are gilt and gauffred in a simple dotted pattern. To the middle of the front
    edge of one of the boards is attached a long green ribbon of silk which wraps round
    both volumes.</p>

    the upper board is a gentleman dressed in the style of the period, with trunk hose of
    red and yellow, a short jacket of the same colouring, and a long, reddish cape. He
    has a broad-brimmed hat with coloured feathers, a large white collar, and a sword in
    his right hand. Near him is a beetle, and in the sky a blue cloud, and he is standing
    upon a grass mound. On the lower board is the figure of a lady in a deep pink dress,
    with white collar and cap. She holds a tall red lily in her right hand, and in the
    upper left-hand corner is a small cloud under which the sun is just appearing, and in

    <p>One of the most finely embroidered bindings existing on satin occurs on a small
    copy of the Psalms, printed in London in 1635, and measuring 3&frac12; by 3 inches.
    The design is one which has been repeated in other sizes with small differences.
    There is a larger specimen at the Bodleian, but the British Museum example is the
    finer altogether.</p>
    <p>On each side there is an oval containing an <span class="pagenum">93</span><a
    name="page_93" id="page_93"></a> elaborate design most delicately worked in
    feather-stitch, the edges and outlines marked with very fine gold twist. On the upper
    board there is a seated allegorical figure with cornucopia, probably representing
    Plenty. Behind her is an ornamental landscape with a piece of water, the bright lines
    of which are feelingly rendered with small stitches of silver thread, hills with
    trees, and a castle in the distance. The other side has a similarly worked figure of
    Peace, a seated figure holding a palm branch; the landscape is of a similar character
    to that on the upper board, but the river or lake has a bridge over it. The work
    itself is of the same very delicate kind, the edges and folds of the dress being
    marked with fine gold twist.</p>
    <p>Each of these ovals is marked by a solid framework with scrolls, strongly made
    with silver threads, and in high relief; in each corner is a very finely worked
    flower or fruit, pansy, strawberry, tulip, and lily. The back is divided into four
    panels, a very decorative conventional flower being worked in each, representing
    probably a red lily, a tulip, a blue and yellow iris, and a daffodil. The edges of
    the boards are bound with a broad silver braid, the edges of the leaves are gilded
    and prettily gauffred, and there are remains of four silver ties.</p>

    <p>There is often much speculation as to who can have worked the English embroidered
    books, and it is very rarely that any reliable information on this interesting point
    is available.</p>
    <p>There is, however, a manuscript note in a copy of the Psalms, printed in 1633 and
    bound in embroidered white satin, that the work upon it was done by 'Elizabeth, wife
    of Matthew Wren, Bishop of Ely,' who was an uncle of the architect. The volume still
    belongs to a member of the family, Dr. W. T. Law of Portland Place, who has most
    kindly allowed me to give an illustration of this beautiful book. It measures 4 by 3
    inches. The design is different in details on each board, the central design,
    however, being in each case contained within a strongly worked gold border in high
    relief, widening out at each extremity into a crownlike form, and richly augmented at
    intervals with clusters of seed pearls. On the upper board within the oval is a
    double rose with curving stem, leaves, and a bud; the petals are worked in
    needlepoint, with fine gold twist at the edges, and a cluster of pearls in the
    centre. In the upper corners are a butterfly, with needlepoint wings, and a bird,
    with needlepoint wing and tail. In the lower corners are a unicorn and an antlered
    stag, both recumbent, and in high relief.</p>
    <p>On the lower board within the oval is a vine, <span class="pagenum">95</span><a
    name="page_95" id="page_95"></a>with curving stem and two large grape clusters,
    tendrils, and leaves, growing from a small green mound. The edges of the petals are
    bound with a fine gold twist, as are also the edges and outlines of the leaves, and
    most of these parts are worked in coloured silks, mixed with fine metal threads, in
    needlepoint lace-stitch.</p>
    <p>A few hazel-nuts are scattered about outside the gold oval, and in each corner is
    a further ornamentation: a reddish butterfly with wings of needlepoint lace in relief
    and edged with a gold cord, a green parrot with red wings and tail, are in the two
    top corners, and in the two lower are a rabbit and a dog, each on a small green
    ground. Innumerable gold spangles are all over the sides and back, each kept in place
    by a small pearl stitched through.</p>
    <p>The back is divided into five panels, by rows of pearls, and a conventional flower
    is in each, except the centre one which has an insect. These are all worked in
    needlepoint and edged with gold twist, the stems of some of them strongly made by a
    kind of braid of gold cords.</p>
    <p>This little book is certainly one of the most ornamental specimens of any of the
    smaller satin-bound books of the seventeenth century, and although here and there
    some of the pearls are gone, altogether it is in very good condition, and it is
    rarely that such a fine example can now be met with in private hands.</p>

    <p>Several of the embroidered books on satin are worked chiefly in metal threads, and
    the designs on such books are not as a rule good. Whether the knowledge that the work
    was to be executed in strong threads has hampered the designer or not cannot be said,
    but certainly there is often a tinselly effect about these bindings that is not
    altogether pleasing.</p>
    <p>In the case of a Bible printed in London in 1638, bound in white satin, and
    measuring 6 by 3 inches, one of the chief ornaments is a cherub's head, the face in
    silver and the hair and wings in gold. The working of this head and wings seems to me
    wrong. The face is, possibly enough, as well done as the material would allow, but
    the hair is made in small curls of gold thread, and the feathers of the wings are
    rendered in a naturalistic way with pieces of flat gold braid. This kind of realism
    is out of place in embroidery, and it is unfortunately characteristic of the English
    embroidered work of about this period, occurring generally on boxes, mirror frames,
    or the like, but only rarely on book-covers. The design is the same on both sides; a
    narrow arch of thick gold cord reaches about three-quarters up the side, and
    interwoven with it is a kind of cusped oval, with leaves, reaching up to the top of
    the book. The lower half of the arch<span class="pagenum">97</span><a name="page_97"
    id="page_97"></a> is enclosed in a rectangular band of silver threads, broad and kept
    in place by transverse bars at regular intervals, and beyond it another row, made of
    patches of red and blue silk alternately. In the lower part of the oval is a ground
    of green silk, on which grow two double roses made of red purl. In the space enclosed
    between the top of the arch and the lower point of the oval is a bird worked in high
    relief in gold with a touch of red silk on his wings. Over the bird is a blue cloud,
    heavily worked in blue silk, and beneath is a small grass plot. The cherub's head
    already described is in the space between the top of the arch and the upper extremity
    of the oval; it is flanked by two small red purl roses. The two upper corners have
    undulating clouds in blue silk, and a red and yellow purl rose between them. There
    are several gold spangles all about, and innumerable small pieces of coloured
    purl.</p>
    <p>The back is divided into four panels, in which are, alternately, a rose-tree on
    which are two red roses with yellow centres and green leaves, growing from a grass
    plot, and a blue rose with yellow centre and green leaves under a red cloud with
    silver rays. There are several spangles and some small pieces of coloured purl
    scattered about in the spaces.</p>
    <p>The book is in excellent condition, owing, no doubt, to the fact that most of it
    is in metal, but it is representative of the lowest level to which the art<span

    in England has ever fallen.</p>

    <p>A charming little piece of delicate workmanship occurs in a copy of the Psalms,
    printed in London in 1639, and bound in white satin. It measures 3 by 2 inches. The
    design on each side is the same, but the work is slightly different. A tall
    rose-tree, with gold stem, grows from a small chenille base, the rose petals
    beautifully worked in the finest of stitches, as well as the leaves, all of which are
    outlined with fine gold thread. From the lower branches of the rose-tree hang on one
    side a violet, and on the other a pansy, each worked in the same way as the rose, and
    edged with fine gold thread. The back is divided into four panels, containing
    respectively a cornflower, a pomegranate, a fruit, perhaps meant for an apple, and a
    honeysuckle, all conventionally treated and very delicately worked. The edge is bound
    all round with a strong braid, and there is one tie of broad, cherry-silk ribbon.
    With this book is its canvas bag, embroidered in silver ground with coloured-silk
    flowers and tassels of silver, the general design and workmanship of which nearly
    resembles that of the finer bag already described at page <a href="#page_16">16</a>. The silver has turned

    <p>A copy of <i>The Way to True Happiness</i>. printed in London in 1639, is bound in
    white satin, and embroidered with figures of David and a Queen. It is a little larger
    than the majority of the satin-embroidered books, measuring 7 by 4&frac12; inches,
    and is, for its time, a very fine specimen. Both figures stand under an archway with
    columns, all worked heavily in silver cord, guimp, and thread. The columns have
    ornamental capitals and a spiral running round their shafts, and the upper edge of
    the arch is ornamented with crockets of a peculiar shape. Within this archway, on the
    upper cover, is a full-length figure of a Queen, finely worked in split-stitch with
    coloured silks. She wears a red dress with long, falling sleeves, a purple body and
    gold collar. On her head is a golden crown, with six points. She carries, in her left
    hand, a golden sceptre, and has also a golden belt. The outlines are everywhere
    marked either with a gold or silver twist. On the ground, which is in small hillocks,
    grow a strawberry and two other small plants; a snail is also shown. Scattered about
    the field are a 'skeleton' caterpillar&mdash;at one time probably filled in with
    peacocks' feathers,&mdash;a conventional lily, a butterfly, and the sun, with rays,
    just appearing from under a cloud. In the two upper <span

    a pansy and another, and smaller ones down each side.</p>
    <p>On the lower board, within the arch, is a figure of David. He wears a short tunic
    of orange and silver, with vandyked edge, and a short skirt of blue and silver, with
    a long cloak of cream, pink, and silver, clasped with a silver brooch; on his head he
    wears a silver crown, with a red cap and green and red feathers; on his feet are
    brown, high boots. In his left hand is a silver harp of ornamental pattern, and in
    his right a silver sceptre with a little gold about it. The ground, in hillocks, has
    a few small flowers growing upon it, and a large tulip is just in front of the King;
    on the field are also a moth and a snail. At the top is a blue cloud. The upper
    corners have a red and yellow tulip and a pansy with bud in them, and smaller flowers
    are worked down each side. The back is very tastefully ornamented with an undulating
    scroll of gold cord, widening out here and there into conventional leaves of gold
    guimp in relief. On this scroll are sitting three birds, and there are also a bunch
    of grapes, a tulip, daffodil, and other flowers with leaves, conventionally treated,
    all worked in coloured silks.</p>

    <p>The curious little New Testament of 1625, now at Oxford, which I have already
    described, is perhaps the earliest example left on which needlepoint lace in coloured
    silks is much employed.</p>
    <p>It occurs again largely on another small New Testament, printed in 1640, bound in
    white satin, measuring 4&frac12; by 2&frac14; inches; now in the British Museum. In
    this case the artist has not attempted the difficult task of producing a satisfactory
    figure in needlework, but has very properly limited her skill to the reproduction of
    flower and animal forms. On the upper cover is a spray of columbine, the petals of
    which, pink and blue, are each worked separately in needlepoint lace stitch, and
    afterwards tacked on to a central rib. The stalks and leaves of this spray are also
    worked in needlepoint, and on the top sits a bullfinch, worked in many colours in the
    same way, but fastened down close to the satin all round. In the corners are a
    beetle, a nondescript flower, a bud, and a butterfly with coloured wings in
    needlepoint, with replicas of them closely appliqu&eacute;s just underneath, on the
    satin. On the lower board is a spray of a five-petalled blue flower, the petals of
    which were originally worked in needlepoint and fastened on a central rib, but <span
    class="pagenum">102</span><a name="page_102" id="page_102"></a>they have now all gone
    except two, leaving the rib of thick pink braid. The supporting replicas underneath
    are, however, perfect, showing what the original upper petals were like. This spray
    has two leaves, exquisitely worked in needlepoint, and fastened by a stitch at one
    end, with the usual flat replicas underneath them, and there is also a bud. The stem
    is a piece of green braid. Above the spray is a parrot in needlepoint, most of him
    fastened down round the edges, but his wings and tail left free. In the upper corner
    are two strawberries, and in the lower a butterfly, with coloured wings, left free in
    needlepoint. There are also two caterpillars on this side.</p>
    <p>On the back are three large flowers heavily worked in silk and metal threads, in
    needlepoint, and appliqu&eacute;s&mdash;a pansy, lily, and rose, with stalks of green
    braid. The boards are edged all round with a gold braid, and there are two green silk
    ties on each for the front edges. There are several gold spangles all about, but many
    more have gone. The work on both boards is very delicate, but that on the back is
    curiously coarse. Such imitative work as the needlepoint, which is perhaps seen at
    its best in the columbine, and the leaves on this book, is at all times a dangerous
    thing to use, except when it is only used as appliqu&eacute;, as in the beautiful
    cover belonging to this book, which I have described on <span
    class="pagenum">103</span><a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a> page <a href="#page_18">18</a>, and the work
    on which is very likely by the same skilled hand as that on the book. I believe this
    use of the needlepoint, or button-hole stitch, is only found in English work; it is
    exactly the same as is used on the old Venetian and other so-called 'point' laces,
    but executed in fine-coloured silk instead of linen thread, and without open
    spaces.</p>

    <p>Nicholas Ferrar's establishment at Little Gidding in Huntingdonshire is often
    credited with having produced embroidered books, but there is really no authority for
    the belief. All the authentic bindings which came from Little Gidding have technical
    shortcomings from a bookbinding point of view, none of which are found on any
    embroidered books.</p>
    <p>In the <i>History of the Worthies of England</i>, by Thomas Fuller, there is a
    short note about Little Gidding, and he says about the ladies there that 'their own
    needles were emploied in learned and pious work to binde Bibles.' This note and the
    mention of needles may have perhaps given the start to the belief that embroidered
    work was intended, but in all probability it only refers to the sewing of the leaves
    of the books upon the bands of the back, which is done with needle and thread.
    Moreover, the ladies of Little Gidding<span class="pagenum">104</span><a
    name="page_104" id="page_104"></a> did actually sew the backs of their books in a
    needlessly elaborate way, putting in ten or twelve bands where three or four would
    have been ample. I also think that if embroidery had been intended by the sentence
    above quoted, it would have been more clearly mentioned. To 'emploie needles to bind
    Bibles' is hardly the description one would expect if the meaning was that when bound
    the Bibles were covered in embroidered work; but it may be safely interpreted as it
    is written, the sewing being a most important part of a bookbinding, and one likely
    to be much thought of by amateur binders, as the nieces of Nicholas Ferrar were.</p>
    <p>The attribution of embroidered bindings to Little Gidding may also have been
    strengthened by the fact that many of the bindings made there are in velvet, the
    ornamentation on which, though it is actually stamped in gold and silver, does to
    some extent suggest embroidery. Indeed, I have myself heard the remark, on showing
    one of these books, 'Oh, yes! Embroidery.'</p>
    <p>Again, a peculiarity of the Little Gidding books is, generally, their large size,
    whereas the embroidered books, especially the satin ones, are usually very small.</p>
    <p>One of the embroidered books thus wrongly credited to Little Gidding is a Psalter,
    printed in London in 1641. It is bound in white satin, very tastefully embroidered,
    the same design being on each side, and measures<span class="pagenum">105</span><a
    name="page_105" id="page_105"></a> 4 by 2 inches. In the centre is a large orange
    tulip, shading from yellow to red, finely worked in silks in shading-stitch. The stem
    is outlined in gold cord, and has also symmetrical curves and leaves, some of which
    are filled in with silver guimp. The flower is enclosed in an ornamental scroll and
    leaf border, all made with gold threads and twists, and having leaf forms in relief
    at intervals in silver guimp. The back has five panels, ornamented alternately with
    guimp scrolls and small spheres of coloured silk. There have been spangles and small
    pieces of guimp scattered about on the sides and back, but most of them have gone.
    There are no ties, and the edges of the leaves are gilt, and have a small gauffred
    pattern upon them.</p>
    <p>The design of this book is extremely simple and effective; the fine stitching on
    the tulip contrasts well with the strong metal border enclosing it. It may be
    considered a favourable specimen of the commonest type of satin embroidered books of
    the seventeenth century. It is not in very good condition.</p>

    <p>A very quaint design embroidered on white satin covers a copy of the Psalms,
    printed in London in 1643, and measuring 4&frac14; by 3&frac14; <span
    class="pagenum">106</span><a name="page_106" id="page_106"></a> inches. On the upper
    side is a representation of Jacob wrestling with the angel, flanked by two trees with
    large leaves; the angel has wings and long petticoats. The lower board has a
    representation of Jacob's dream. The patriarch is asleep on the grass, his head upon
    a white stone, his staff and gourd by his side. He has pale hair and beard. Behind
    him is a large tree, and in front a conventional flower with leaves and bud, and from
    the clouds reaches a ladder on which are three small winged angels, two coming down,
    and one between them going up. Through a break in the clouds is seen a bright space,
    with rays of golden light proceeding from it.</p>
    <p>The back is divided into five panels, in each of which is a flower. These
    resemble, to some extent, a red tulip, a lily, a red dahlia, a yellow tulip, and a
    red rose. The work here is not protected by any strong or metal threads, and it is
    consequently much worn. There are no signs of any tie ribbon, and the edges are
    plainly gilt.</p>

    <p>Another copy of the Psalms, printed in London in 1643, bound in satin, and
    measuring 3&frac14; by 2&frac14; inches, bears on each side, within a circle, a
    miniature portrait of Charles <span class="smcap">i</span>. worked in feather-stitch.
    The king wears long hair, moustache, and small pointed beard. He is <span
    class="pagenum">107</span><a name="page_107" id="page_107"></a> crowned, and has a
    red cloak with miniver tippet, from under which appears the blue ribbon of the Garter
    worn round the neck, as it originally was, and having a small gold medallion attached
    to it. The initials C. R. in gold guimp are at each side. The circle is enclosed in a
    strong framework of silver cord and guimp in the form of four thin long pointed ovals
    of leaf form arranged as a diamond. The four triangular spaces between the diamond
    and the oval are filled with small flowers or small pieces of guimp and spangles.
    Towards each corner grows a flower, two pansies, and two others with regular petals.
    The remaining spaces are filled variously with green leaves, small patches of purl
    and gold spangles, and a strong gold cord encloses the whole. The back is divided
    into three panels, in each of which is an ornamental conventional flower, the upper
    and lower ones alike, and worked in shades of red with guimp leaves in relief, and
    the centre one with six petals worked in yellow and edged with a fine gold cord.
    There are no signs of ties ever having existed, and the edges of the leaves are gilt
    and slightly gauffred. It has been suggested that this little book may have belonged
    to King Charles <span class="smcap">i</span>.; but the fact of his portrait being
    upon it is no proof of this, as portraits of this king are more numerous upon the
    bindings of English books than those of any other person.</p>

    <p>The value of 'purl' was recognised some few years back, when I had some made, and
    explained its value and use to the Royal School of Art Needlework at South
    Kensington, and I believe they used it considerably.</p>
    <p>On books the use of purl is generally auxiliary, but one small book bound in white
    satin, and measuring 4 by 2&frac12; inches, a copy of the Psalms, printed in London
    in 1646, is entirely embroidered in this material, helped with gold braid and cord.
    The design is approximately the same on each side, a large flower with leaves in the
    centre, and a smaller flower in each corner. On the upper cover the centre flower is
    yellow and red, with two large green leaves, and the corner flowers are, possibly,
    intended for a cornflower, a jonquil, a lily, and a rose, but the material is so
    unwieldy that the forms are difficult to trace, and flowers worked in it are likely
    to assume forms that are unrecognisable, when finished, however well designed to
    start with. All the flowers and leaves are made with the purl cut into short lengths,
    drawn together at the ends by a thread run through, thus forming a succession of
    small arches. The stalks are made in gold cord. The flowers on the other side are,
    perhaps, a carnation in the centre, and round it a convolvulus, lily, daffodil, and
    rose. The back is divided into five <span class="pagenum">109</span><a
    name="page_109" id="page_109"></a> panels, in each of which is a 'purl' flower, all
    worked in the same way, representing successively a tulip, cornflower, carnation,
    lily, rose, or something analogous to them; round the designs are straight pieces of
    brown purl, and the edges are bound with a broad gold braid. There are no ties or
    signs of any, and the edges are simply gilt. The purl is undoubtedly very strong; I
    possess a small patch-box worked on white satin in a similar way to this little book,
    and although it has been roughly used for some two hundred and fifty years, the
    colour of the purl is still good; the upper surfaces of the small spirals, however,
    show the copper wire bare almost everywhere. The book, not having had anything like
    the hard wear, is in very good condition, but it is too small for the proper use of
    so much thick thread. The larger leaves and petals are made in relief by being sewn
    on over a few pieces of purl laid underneath them at right angles.</p>

    <p>A Bible printed in London in 1646 is bound in white satin, and embroidered in
    coloured silks and gold braid and cord, measuring 6 by 3&frac12; inches. The same
    design is on both sides. In the centre within an oval of gold braid and cord is a
    spray of vine, with two bunches of grapes, three leaves and a tendril, the fruit and
    leaves worked in silk, and the <span class="pagenum">110</span><a name="page_110"
    id="page_110"></a> stem in gold cord. Enclosing the oval is an arabesque design
    worked in gold cord and guimp, and at each corner is an oval of thin gold strips and
    gold cord; the gold strips are done in the manner known as 'lizzarding,' and are kept
    down by small stitches at intervals.</p>
    <p>The back has four panels, in each of which is an arabesque design in coloured
    silks and gold cord or braid. Although this book is comparatively late, it is in a
    bad condition, and shows much wear; the design also is weak, and the workmanship
    inferior.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
